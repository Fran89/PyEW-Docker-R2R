<a class="wiki" href="sendfileII.html">sendfileII</a> + <a class="wiki" href="getfileII.html">getfileII</a> + <a class="wiki" href="makehbfile.html">makehbfile</a> + = A set of programs used to transfer files between computers running Windows 2000 and/or Sun Solaris. These programs do not require an Earthworm setup.
</p>
<h2 id="Details">Details</h2>
<h3 id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p>
The sendfileII, getfileII, and makehbfile programs are used to transfer files between computers running Windows NT and/or Sun Solaris. The programs run continuously, so they are appropriate for real-time applications. These programs are based on the work of Will Kohler at the Menlo Park USGS campus. These programs are distributed as part of Earthworm, but they can do not depend on any other parts of Earthworm. Each of the three programs is self-contained; no Earthworm library functions are used in them.
</p>
<p>
SendfileII and getfileII use a slightly different protocol than the original sendfile and getfile. THEY ARE NOT COMPATIBLE. See the CHANGES section for a summary of these differences and other recent changes to the programs.
</p>
<p>
The sendfileII program gets files from a "queue directory", transmits the files via a socket connection, and deletes the files from the queue directory. The getfileII program receives data files from sendfileII via a socket connection and saves them in specified directories. The makehbfile program periodically places a "heartbeat file" in the queue directory used bysendfileII. If the network connection between computers is down for any reason, files will accumulate in sendfileII's queue directory until the network comes back up. Then all files will be sent immediately.
</p>
<p>
One getfileII process can accept files from up to 100 sendfileII processesrunning on different computers. However, getfileII will handle only a single file transaction at a time. That is, getfileII is a single-threaded, non-forking process.
</p>
<p>
WARNING: The sendfileII and getfileII programs don't do any data "translation". If binary files are transferred, the data format and byte-order of the file may be incompatible with the receiving computer. Fortext files, no end-of-line translation is done. Thus it is up to the programs supplying files to sendfileII and consuming files from getfileII to agree on file formats.
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<h3 id="INSTALLATIONANDSTARTUP">INSTALLATION AND STARTUP</h3>
<p>
The distribution directory for each program contains executable files for Windows and Solaris. Windows executable files are named &lt;progname&gt;.exe, and Solaris executable files are named &lt;progname&gt;. To install the programs, simply copy the executable files to any directory which is in the user's search path. The programs can also be run by typing the full path name. The name of the program configuration file is specified on the command line, eg: sendfileII sendfileII.d or getfileII getfileII.d On Solaris, the programs can be run from the command line, or they can be started automatically at boot time. On Windows NT, the executable (or a shortcut to the executable) can be placed in the users startup directory. See Windows documentation for details.
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<h3 id="COMPILINGTHEPROGRAMS">COMPILING THE PROGRAMS</h3>
<p>
If it's necessary to recompile a program, change the working directory to the program distribution directory. On a Windows NT system, type:
</p>
<p>
nmake /f makefile.nt
</p>
<p>
On a Solaris system, type:
</p>
<p>
make -f makefile.sol
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
The programs were compiled using Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 on Windows NT, and Sun C 4.2 on Solaris 2.7. All user functions are included in the distribution directories.
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<h3 id="SENDFILEIINOTES">SENDFILEII NOTES</h3>
<p>
The sendfileII program requires a configuration file, typically named sendfileII.d. A sample configuration file is included in the distribution directory and is shown below. Any line which begins with the # sign is interpreted as a comment, so feel free to add your own comment lines. The output (queue) and log directories must exist before running the program.
</p>
<p>
They should be created manually using the mkdir command (or the equivalent windows/file manager operation). In Solaris, the user must have write permission for these directories.
</p>
<p>
The TimeZone parameter is only used on Windows NT for timestamping entries in the log file.

<p>
After the sendfileII program is invoked, it patiently waits for files to appear in output queue directory. When it detects a file, it opens a socket connection to getfileII, sends the file, and then deletes the file from the queue directory. Under Windows NT, if a file is copied or moved to the queue directory using the "copy" or "move" command (recommended), sendfileII will wait until the file is completely transferred to the queue directory before it is sent to getfileII. This prevents a partial file from being sent. The Windows version also uses the _fsopen() system call which provides file locking. SendfileII waits until all other processes are done with a file before accessing it. The Solaris version of sendfileII works somewhat differently. If a file is cp'd to or created in the queue directory, the file may not be complete when sendfileII starts to send it. Thus it is possible that sendfileII might not transfer the whole file. The preferred technique is to create a complete file in another directory in same disk partition (file system) as the queue directory. Then create a hard link to the queue directory using the command:
</p>
<p>
ln &lt;file&gt; &lt;queue directory)
</p>
<p>
After the file has been transferred by sendfileII, sendfileII will remove the link, which leaves the original file intact.
</p>
<p>
An alternative is to create the file on another directory on the same disk partition and move it to the queue directory using the mv command. After the file has been transferred by sendfileII, sendfileII will delete the file from the queue directory. This directory for creating files may be located within the queue directory. That is because sendfileII will never attempt to transfer a directory; it will only transfer files.
</p>
<p>

The getfileII program requires a configuration file, typically named getfileII.d. A sample configuration file is included in the distribution directory and is shown below. Any line which begins with the # sign is interpreted as a comment, so feel free to add your own comment lines. The input, temporary, and log directories must exist before running the program. They should be created manually using the mkdir command (or the equivalent windows/file manager operation). The user must have writepermission for these directories.

<p>
The getfileII program accepts connections from up to 100 sendfileII processes on remote systems. Only one socket connection at a time is allowed. If a sendfileII process wants to connect while the getfileII connection is busy, getfileII will queue the connection request. GetfileII writes data from the socket connection to a directory of temporary files. After the data transfer from the socket is complete, getfileII moves the file from the temporary directory to the client directories. This ensures that all files in the client directories are complete.
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<h3 id="MAKEHBFILENOTES">MAKEHBFILE NOTES</h3>
<p>
The makehbfile program makes heartbeat files and places them in a specified directory. The output directory should be the same as the sendfileII queue directory, and it must exist before running makehbfile. Makehbfile uses a directory named "temp.dir" for creating its heartbeat files before moving them to the output directory. It will create this directory within theoutput directory if it does not exist at startup. The makehbfile program requires a configuration file, typically named makehbfile.d. A sample configuration file is included in the distribution directory and is shown below. Any line which begins with the # sign is interpreted as a comment, so feel free to add your own comment lines.
</p>
<pre class="wiki">#

# makehbfile.d - Configuration file for the makehbfile program

#

# Path = Name of directory to contain heartbeat files.

# HbName = Name of the heartbeat file (without path)

# Interval = Create a heartbeat file every "Interval" seconds

#

-HbName hb.hollyhock

-Interval 60

# Solaris

-Path /home/earthworm/outdir

# Windows

#-Path c:\earthworm\outdir
</pre><p>
All heartbeat files will be created with the same name, as specified in the makehbfile configuration file. If a heartbeat file already exists in the output directory, it will be overwritten by the most recent heartbeat file.
</p>
<p>
All heartbeat files contain a sequence of ASCII characters representing the computer system time, in seconds since midnight, Jan 1, 1970.
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<h3 id="PROTOCOL">PROTOCOL</h3>
<p>
SendfileII and getfileII use the following protocol for transferring files. GetfileII opens its socket to listen on the TCP "ServerPort". When sendfileII has a file to send, it will make a connection to the getfileII socket. Each "block" of data that sendfileII sends is preceded by a six-digit integer indicating the block size. SendfileII first sends the name of the file it is about to transmit (preceded by the name length as described above). It then sends blocks of 4096 characters of file contents (or the remaining file contents if less than 4096) to getfileII. Again, each block is preceded by its size.
</p>
<p>
After sendfileII has completed sending the file, it sends one more six-digit integer of zeros, to indicate that the file transmission is complete. When getfileII accepts the connection from sendfileII and receives the file name, it will create a new file by this name in TempDir. GetfileII will then write the data it receives from sendfileII into this file. When getfileII receives the file block size of zero, it will close the file in TempDir and move it to the directory for the client from which it received the file. GetfileII will also send the three characters "ACK" back to sendfileII when getfileII has successfully written the file to disk in TempDir.
</p>
<p>
If getfileII has errors receiving the file data, sending the "ACK", or times out receiving or sending, it will close its active socket, delete the file from TempDir, and go back to listening for client connections. If sendfileII has errors connecting to getfileII, has errors sending the file, or cannot send a packet within "TimeOut" seconds, it will close its socket, wait for "RetryInterval" seconds, and make another attempt to send the file. It will keep trying to send the file until it has received and acknowledgment from getfileII.
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<h3 id="CHANGES">CHANGES</h3>
<p>
2002/12/09
</p>
<p>
Changed names from getfile to getfileII and from sendfile to sendfileII, due
</p>
<p>
to changes in the protocol used by these two programs.
</p>
<p>
GetfileII now sends the three characters "ACK" to sendfileII after getfileII has received the entire file.
</p>
<p>
SendfileII now waits "AckTimeOut" seconds for the "ACK" from getfileII after sendfileII has completed sending the file. If sendfileII does not receive "ACK" within the timeout interval, it assumes that getfileII did not receive the entire file. So sendfileII will make additional attempts to send this same file after waiting "RetryInterval" seconds.
</p>
<p>
A bug was fixed in getfileII whereby incomplete files were moved from TempDir to the output directory. Now if getfileII failed to receive the complete file, it will delete the incomplete files from TempDir and it will not send the "ACK" to sendfileII.
