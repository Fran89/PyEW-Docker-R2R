<strong>Contributed by: </strong>

<h2 id="Function">Function</h2>
<p>
Initiates preliminary event processing (alternate head of mega-module).
</p>
<h2 id="Details">Details</h2>
<p>
Eqprelim is a first process in the earthquake-processing mega-module (sometimes referred to as "the sausage") that produces preliminary earthquake locations for the Earthworm system. Eqprelim is very similar to eqroc, which produces Earthworm's final event locations. Only eqprelim, the first link in the mega-module, is listed in startstop's configuration file to be started by startstop. Eqprelim then starts the next process, specified in its "PipeTo" command, and communicates with it via a one-directional pipe. Each newly created sub-module starts the next link in the same way. From startstop's point of view, the whole mega-module inherits the name of the first link (eqprelim) and that's the only name it displays. From statmgr's point of view, all processes within the mega-module share one module id, one heartbeat, and one descriptor file. However, each sub-module has its own configuration file and its own log file.
</p>
<p>
After starting up the next link in "the sausage," eqprelim's main job is to gather information from picker(s) and binder, to decide when it's time to report a preliminary hypocenter for a given event, to assemble all the information related to that event, and to pass it on to the next event-processing sub-module.
</p>
<p>
Eqprelim collects messages from the picker(s) (TYPE_PICK2K and TYPE_CODA2K) and from binder (TYPE_QUAKE2K and TYPE_LINK). A TYPE_PICK2K message contains an observed P-wave arrival-time and amplitude for a given seismic channel along with the installation id, module id, and pick sequence number; the picker releases the pick message within ~3 seconds of a P-wave detection. A TYPE_CODA2K message contains coda duration and amplitude information along with the installation id, module id, and sequence number of the pick it relates to; the picker releases the coda message up to 144 seconds after its corresponding pick message. A TYPE_QUAKE2K message contains an event id number, origin time and hypocenter; binder issues a new quake message each time it associates a new pick with [or deletes pick(s) from] a given event id. A TYPE_LINK message contains an event id, an installation id, a picker module id, a pick sequence number and a phase identifier; binder issues a new link message for every pick it associates with (or deletes from) an active event.
</p>
<p>
Eqprelim maintains two circular buffers:
</p>
<ol><li>Pick list
Contains the most recent MAXPCK (=1000) picks and their coda and link information (related by installation id, module id and pick sequence number) and the system-time that the pick was entered.
</li></ol><ol start="2"><li>Quake list
Contains the most recent location and status of the last MAXHYP (=100) event ids and the system-time that the location was entered.
</li></ol><p>
Each time eqprelim receives a TYPE_QUAKE2K message, it checks to see how many phases are associated with that event id. If the number of P-arrivals associated the event is greater than or equal to "NumPickNotify" (set in the configuration file), eqprelim initiates preliminary earthquake processing.
</p>
<p>
Eqprelim:
</p>
<ol><li>gathers from its pick list all picks linked to that event id. If some picks do not have coda information yet, eqprelim continues the preliminary processing with zeroed coda information for those picks.
</li><li>builds an ascii TYPE_EVENT2K message containing the event's location and all of its supporting phase information,
</li><li>pipes the TYPE_EVENT2K message to the next process in the mega-module,
</li><li>notes in its quake list that the status of this event id is "preliminary location done."
</li></ol><p>
Eqprelim will initiate only one preliminary location per binder event id, so NumPickNotify should be set at the number of phases where most event locations become stable. Often, no coda information or only poor coda information is available at the time eqprelim initiates the preliminary location. Thus most preliminary locations will have poor or absent duration magnitudes.
</p>
<p>
Note: It is possible that binder may kill an event (decide it was not real) after eqprelim has initiated the preliminary location. Eqprelim does not send out any kind of "event killed" messages. One must assume that if a final location (via eqproc) does not arrive within a given time interval (say 5-10 minutes), then the preliminary location was for a busted event.
</p>
<h2 id="ConfigurationFileCommands">Configuration File Commands</h2>
<p>
On startup, eqprelim reads the configuration file named on the command-line. Commands in this file set up all parameters used in making preliminary earthquake notifications. In the control file, lines may begin with a valid eqprelim command (listed below) or with one of 2 special characters:
</p>
<pre class="wiki">#  marks the line as a comment (example: # This is a comment).

@  allows control files to be nested; one control file can be
   accessed from another with the command "@" followed by
   a string representing the path name of the next control file
   (example: @model.d).
</pre><p>
Command names must be typed in the control file exactly as shown in this document (upper/lower case matters!).

<strong>lay [depth velocity]</strong><br />
Processed by: t_com<br />
Function: model
</p>
<p>
Defines the layered velocity structure to be used for calculating travel times. depth is the distance (km) to the top of the layer, and velocity is the seismic P-wave velocity (km/sec) within that layer. No default velocity structure is defined; therefore, the user must always supply one in the control file. Up to 20 layers can be specified, and they should be listed in order of increasing depth.
</p>
<p>
Note: binder and eqprelim calculate travel times independently. Be sure that both programs are using the same velocity model!

Function: output
</p>
<p>
Sets the on-off switch for writing a log file to disk. If switch is 0, no log file will be written. If switch is 1, eqprelim will write a daily log file(s) called eqprelimxx.log_yymmdd where xx is eqprelim's module id (set with "MyModuleId" command) and yymmdd is the current UTC date (ex: 960123) on the system clock.

<strong>NumPickNotify [npck]</strong><br />
Processed by: eqprelim_config<br />
Function: notification
</p>
<p>
Sets the threshold for initiating preliminary event processing. When an event has at least npck P-arrivals associated with it, eqprelim will pipe that event to the process specified in the "PipeTo" command. Eqprelim will initiate only one preliminary location per binder eventid, so npck should be set at the number of phases where most event locations become stable (where additional picks won't change the location).

<h3 id="THEMEGA-MODULEWHICHBEGINSWITHEQPRELIM">THE "MEGA-MODULE" WHICH BEGINS WITH EQPRELIM</h3>
<p>
The eqprelim "mega-module" is a chain of processes that produces preliminary earthquake locations for the Earthworm system. Only eqprelim, the first link in the mega-module, is listed in startstop's configuration file to be started by startstop. Eqprelim then starts the next process, specified in its "PipeTo" command, and communicates with it via a pipe. Each newly created process starts the next link in the same way. From startstop's point of view, the whole mega-module inherits the name of the first link (eqprelim) and that's the only name it displays. From statmgr's point of view, all processes within the mega-module share one module id, one heartbeat, and one descriptor file. However, each process has its own configuration file and its own log file.

As of 10 October, 1996, the eqprelim mega-module consists of the following "links":
</p>
<pre class="wiki">  SUB-MODULE    INPUT FROM   		  	OUTPUT TO
  ----------	----------		  	---------
  eqprelim 	shared memory (PICK_RING)	pipe to eqbuf
  eqbuf   	stdin (pipe from eqprelim)   	pipe to eqcoda
  eqcoda	stdin (pipe from eqbuf)    	pipe to eqverify
  eqverify	stdin (pipe from eqcoda)   	pipe to hypo_mgr
  hypo_mgr	stdin (pipe from eqverify)	shared memory (HYPO_RING)
</pre><h4 id="Inter-linkIntra-mega-moduleCommunication">Inter-link (Intra-mega-module) Communication</h4>
<p>
All messages are passed between the processes of the mega-module via pipes. The pipe communications are encapsulated in a set of routines containing the peculiarities of the operating system. Messages, with types defined in earthworm.d, are sent from one link to the next, in one direction only! If a process doesn't need to do anything with a given message type, it just pipes it along to the next link. The current pipe routines (in pipe.c) are:
</p>
<pre class="wiki">  pipe_init   	starts up the next "link", replacing its stdin with
		a pipe from the "parent" program.
  pipe_put	writes a message of a given type to the pipe.
  pipe_get	gets the next message from the pipe.
  pipe_close    closes the pipe.
</pre><h4 id="Heartbeats">Heartbeats</h4>
<p>
The mega-module has one module-id and one heartbeat. The heartbeat initiates at the first link (eqprelim), is piped through all the links, and is deposited into shared memory by the last link (in this case, hypo_mgr). If any of the links dies, no heartbeat will be seen by statmgr and it will complain appropriately.
</p>
<h4 id="ErrorMessages">Error Messages</h4>
<p>
Since the whole mega-module has only one module-id, the sub-modules need to share the complete set of error numbers within a common descriptor file. Each link is assigned a block of error numbers to use for its complaints. Each link passes along any error messages it reads from the pipe. The last link puts all error messages into shared memory where they are available to statmgr. Statmgr reads one descriptor file for the mega-module.
</p>
<h4 id="FinalOutputfromMega-module">Final Output from Mega-module</h4>
<p>
The last link in the mega-module, hypo_mgr, deposits heartbeats, error messages, and event messages (that look like hypoinverse archive files) onto shared memory where any other Earthworm module can find them.
