This directory contains the documentation for Earthworm.

See the 'WEB_DOC' directory; start with the index.html file.


Also:
The static version of the online wiki you can find at 
http://earthwormcentral.com/trac/ew/wiki
is in the 'wiki' directory; start with the WikiStart.html page

The script used to create this static version is contained in this directory,
called get_wiki.bash -- worked on Windows under cygwin, probably would work
fine on any unix with wget.

Ignore:
Some of the images and css for the wiki html are in 'chrome' and 
'raw-attachment' -- you can ignore these directories, but don't
delete them.
