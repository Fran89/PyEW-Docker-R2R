<center><b><font size=+1>How to Configure Multiple Ethernet Adapters under
NT</font></b>
<br>(Lucky Vidmar, January 2002)</center>

<p><br>
<p>The presenting problem is that Windows NT appears to automatically decide
which adapter to use for all network traffic. This seems to be governed
by some sort of load-maximizing algorithm. To make sure that this does
not happen to you, it is important to set up your ethernet adapters with
care:
<p>For any adapter connected to the internet:
<br>&nbsp;- specify IP address
<br>&nbsp;- specify subnet mask
<br>&nbsp;- specify the default gateway
<p>For all other adapters that do not go out to the internet, but are instead
<br>used as "private" networks,
<br>&nbsp;- specify IP address
<br>&nbsp;- specify subnet mask
<br>&nbsp;- LEAVE DEFAULT GATEWAY FIELD BLANK
<p>Also, make sure that the "IP&nbsp;Forwarding"&nbsp;option is turned
off.
