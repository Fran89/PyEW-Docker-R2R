<br>Planning to use an external time source with NT 4.0? Read on.....
<p>Date and Time are stored in a PC with a battery powered chip set called
the CMOS RAM/ Real Time Clock. The BIOS calls the Real Time Clock to get
the current time/date on boot-up and passes this data to the operating
system. DOS works this way, but NT 4.0 does it differently.
<p>At boot time, Windows NT 4.0 gets the SYSTEM time directly from the
Real Time Clock (instead of the BIOS). SYSTEM time is a data structure
stored in RAM. In bypassing the BIOS code and going directly to the Real
Time Clock for time, Windows NT 4.0 can avoid any problems associated with
non-compliant BIOS code. (Microsoft's explanation)
<br>No other applications or services may read or write to the Real Time
Clock because NT 4.0 prevents any direct calls. NT 4.0's access to the
Real Time Clock is via the Win32 SetSystemTime() function. TIME and NET
TIME commands in a cmd window are examples of the use of this function.
<p>SYSTEM time is maintained by the operating system (via the CPU) with
an 18.2-Hertz timer chip that updates the time data structure every 55
milliseconds. This timer has much greater precision than the Real Time
Clock (which updates approximately every second). But for some unknown
reason, Microsoft chooses to keep SYSTEM time synchronized with the CMOS/RAM
Real Time Clock. This is called CMOS synchron-ization is enforced by the
"time daemon".
<p>The NT 4.0 kernel calls the time daemon hourly to compare SYSTEM time
with the Real Time Clock. If the two are significantly different (more
than one minute different), the time daemon updates SYSTEM time from the
relatively poor precision Real Time Clock. Stated another way, when the
two clocks drift apart or SYSTEM time is updated (or changed) from a different
source, they are re-set (synchronized) to the CMOS/Real Time Clock time
by the time daemon.
<p>CMOS synchronization in Windows NT 4.0 can be defeated by the Win32
function
<br>SetSystemTimeAdjustment(). By specifying the bTimeAdjustmentDisabled
= FALSE option, SYSTEM time will be updated using only the 18.2-Hertz timer.
This option should be considered whenever external time sources are used
for setting SYSTEM time in Windows NT 4.0. Time servers, such as Timeserv.exe
in the Microsoft NT 4.0 Server Resource Kit use this option.
<p>With CMOS synchronization enabled, (the default action in NT) any attempt
to achieve continuous accurate time from an outside source will eventually
fail because the time daemon will re-set the SYSTEM time data structure
to the low-precision Real Time Clock time whenever it sees a one minute
difference in time.
<p>=========================================================================================
<br>Attachment 1:
<p>This is part of the documentation from an app called Timeserv.exe which
is in the NT Resource Kit (server only) The program allows you use an external
timesource to set time on an NT box. It can use the Naval Observatory (via
modem) a GPS signal (via a com port) or even a user supplied hardware board
(using his .dll to communicate with it) Once configured, this app runs
as an NT service with no user intervention.
<br>The author's homepage is http://home1.gte.net/dougho/TimeServ.html
<p>Accuracy Information for Windows NT
<br>From TimeServ documentation
<br>http://home1.gte.net/dougho/TimeServ.html
<p>A default entry in timeserv.ini is TASync=no. This is one of the main
reasons that TimeServ is not supported for Windows NT 3.1. It specifies
that the TimeAdjustment flag in the system should be fixed and skew compensation
allowed. By default, Windows NT regularly syncs the time to the CMOS RTC
(on 3.51 or later it only does this when time is off by at least one minute).
By specifying this option on the first time set after each boot, the clock
will run using only the 8254-based timer which has greater precision and
can result in greater stability. In this mode, skew compensation is possible
(for error in the rate of the system timer). Of course, if CMOS sync is
not disabled, the long term clock will take on the characteristics of the
CMOS RTC with poor precision. Assuming that CMOS sync is disabled and using
the popular i486 or uniprocessor Pentium CPU type, setting your time daily
should result in a clock with maximum +/-.45 second error (twice daily
+/-.22s, four times daily +/-.10s, etc). These figures are for TimeServ
obtaining the time from a non-network source. Detailed skew compensation
is not normally attempted when using a network source because of inconsistent
delays over the network. In such cases if you notice time drifting more
with TimeServ than you had experienced before, you might want to set TASync=yes.
<p>Warning: For skew compensation to work properly, you should never set
the time manually while TimeServ is running. If you must set the time manually,
either stop the Time Service first (and restart it after, if desired),
or set TASync=yes.
<br>=================================================================================================
<p>This documentation is from the Microsoft SDK for SetSystemTimeAdjustment().
<p>The SetSystemTimeAdjustment function tells the system to enable or disable
periodic time adjustments to its time of day clock. Such time adjustments
are used to synchronize the time of day with some other source of time
information. When periodic time adjustments are enabled, they are applied
at each clock interrupt.
<br>BOOL SetSystemTimeAdjustment(
<br>&nbsp;
<p>DWORD dwTimeAdjustment, // size, in 100-nanosecond units, of a periodic
time adjustment
<br>BOOL bTimeAdjustmentDisabled // whether periodic time adjustment is
to be disabled or enabled
<br>);
<p>Parameters
<p>dwTimeAdjustment
<br>Specifies the number of 100-nanosecond units added to the time-of-day
clock at each clock interrupt if periodic time adjustment is enabled.
<p>bTimeAdjustmentDisabled
<br>Specifies the time adjustment mode that the system is to use. Periodic
system time adjustments can be disabled or enabled.
<p>A value of TRUE specifies that periodic time adjustment is to be disabled.
The system is free to adjust time of day using its own internal mechanisms.
The value of dwTimeAdjustment is ignored. The system's internal adjustment
mechanisms may cause the time-of-day clock to jump noticeably when adjustments
are made.
<p>A value of FALSE specifies that periodic time adjustment is to be enabled,
and will be used to adjust the time-of-day clock. The system will not interfere
with the time adjustment scheme, and will not attempt to synchronize time
of day on its own. The system will add the value of dwTimeAdjustment to
the time of day at each clock interrupt.
<p>Return Value
<br>If the function succeeds, the return value is TRUE.
<br>If the function fails, the return value is FALSE. To get extended error
information, call GetLastError. One way the function can fail is if the
caller does not possess the SE_SYSTEMTIME_NAME privilege.
<p>Remarks
<br>The GetSystemTimeAdjustment and SetSystemTimeAdjustment functions support
algorithms that synchronize the time-of-day clock, reported via GetSystemTime
and GetLocalTime, with another time source using a periodic time adjustment.
<p>The SetSystemTimeAdjustment function supports two modes of time synchronization:
time-adjustment - disabled and time-adjustment - enabled.
<p>In the first mode, bTimeAdjustmentDisabled is set to FALSE. At each
clock interrupt, the system adds the value of dwTimeAdjustment to the time
of day. The clock interrupt rate may be determined by calling GetSystemTimeAdjustment,
and looking at the returned value of the DWORD value pointed to by lpTimeIncrement.
<p>In the second mode, bTimeAdjustmentDisabled is set to TRUE. At each
clock interrupt, the system adds the interval between clock interrupts
to the time of day. No adjustment to that interval is made. The system
is free to periodically refresh the time-of-day clock using other techniques.
Such other techniques may cause the time-of-day clock to jump noticeably
when adjustments are made.
<p>An application must have system-time privilege (the SE_SYSTEMTIME_NAME
privilege) for this function to succeed. The SE_SYSTEMTIME_NAME privilege
is disabled by default. Use the AdjustTokenPrivileges function to enable
the privilege before calling SetSystemTimeAdjustment, and then to disable
the privilege after the SetSystemTimeAdjustment call.
