Subject: New Earthworm Release


Earthworm Version 3.92 has been released.  

You can download the release from our new ftp site:
	ghtftp.cr.usgs.gov:pub/OUTGOING/earthworm/release_v3.92

IMPORTANT NOTICE TO ADSEND USERS
********************************

Earthworm module 'adsend' WILL FREEZE an NT system if restarted with the
Earthworm RESTARTME mechanism.  Do not use this feature with 'adsend'.


NEW MODULES
********************
ew2rsam: This module reads trace messages and computes
  rsam values over time periods defined in the configuration file.
  The rsam values are written out to the OutRing as message
  type TYPE_RSAM containing the structure RSAM_MSG.
  The rsam computation algorithm was provided by Tom Murray
  (tlmurray@usgs.gov). 

IMPORTANT CHANGE- AFFECTS ALL MODULES
*************************************
*************************************

All modules are affected by the following change:

All modules read the "Installation IDs" from an ASCII file named 
earthworm_inst.d in the EW_PARAMS directory.  In previous versions of 
Earthworm, the installation ids were compiled into executables. The 
official copy of earthworm_inst.d resides in the vX.X/environment 
directory; a working copy must be placed in the EW_PARAMS directory. 

This makes it simpler to add official installation ids, without 
producing an entire new version of Earthworm. Assignment of installation 
ids is still under the control of the Earthworm development team. Please 
notify Barbara Bogaert, bogaert@usgs.gov to have an Installation ID 
assigned.


IMPORTANT NOTICE TO ADSEND USERS
********************************

Earthworm module 'adsend' will not freeze an NT system if restarted with 
the Earthworm RESTARTME mechanism.  Do not use this feature with 
'adsend'.

CONTRIBUTED SOFTWARE
********************

Many Earthworm modules have been developed at regional networks to meet 
their specific needs.  Since some of these may be useful to other 
networks, we make these available at the Earthworm ftp site in the 
Contributed_software directory.  Currently, you will find modules 
developed at USGS Menlo Park, University of Memphis,  University of 
Washington and University of Alaska, Fairbanks.

If you have questions or comments, please contact me at 
bogaert@usgs.gov.
