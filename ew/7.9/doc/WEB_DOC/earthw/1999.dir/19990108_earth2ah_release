Subject: new worm tool


I have written a new earthworm program (NOT a module; a stand alone executable)
called earth2ah.  It is a command line executable that queries the wave_server
for scn's and dumps ah_xdr trace files. It is a clone of Pete Lombard's earth2sac
with two notable exeptions:

1) added -L <filename> switch where filename contains a simple list of station,
channel, network cards (wildcards okay, comments and jumps not okay).  This
is intended to avoid getting an entire wave_servers channels and avoid having
to know the details of the UW trigger message format.  Must supply starttime
and duration as the last two args to the earth2ah call.

2) added NT stupidity for the masochists who insist on using this OS.

An example calling script is supplied.  For those who like man pages, it's
easiest to just look at the one Pete wrote for earth2sac 'cause I'm lazy.

It is available on the earthworm development machine in earthworm/UM/earth2ah,
by contacting me at withers@ceri.memphis.edu.
