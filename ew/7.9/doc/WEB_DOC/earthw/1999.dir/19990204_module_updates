Subject: New and Enhanced Earthworm modules available

A number of  new or enhanced modules are available at the Earthworm ftp site:
ghtftp.cr.usgs.gov:~ftp/pub/OUTGOING/earthworm/pre_release. These modules are
compatible with Earthworm Version 3.9.

Reftek2ew:
        Is the coupler module provided by Refraction Technologies Inc. The
module translates data from the RTP format into the Earthworm trace data
format.  The makefiles for both Solaris and NT were modified to better reflect
the Earthworm directory structure. Along with this module, there are several
other programs provided by Reftek which are necessary to communicate with the
Reftek boxes.

Modifications and enhancements were also made to modules rcv, adsend, statmgr. 
The changes are described in the file README in the pre_release directory.
