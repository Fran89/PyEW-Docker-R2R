Subject: new earth2ah


I have moved the old version of earth2ah on gldrocky to earth2ah3.3.
Recall that earth2ah is a standalone executable (not a module)
that allows grabbing user specified slices of data from a wave_serverV
and writing to ah_xdr format data files (new version has sac too).
It runs under both NT and Solaris.

It is available from the earthworm developement crew in the UM directory.
(Or I can supply it directly, much to Alex's consternation).

The new version of earth2ah has the following enhancements:

     -v3.9 compliant. Will not compile under 3.3 but will still
           probably work (sorry I've no way to test this).

     -still runs and compiles under both NT and Solaris but
      you must source your ew_XX.cmd to recompile.

     -still a standalone executable (with man.1/earthworm.1
       man pages at Steve Malone's encouragement [insistence?]).

     -uses standard earthworm libraries instead of local ones

     -uses trig2disk putaway routines instead of local ones
      (so we only have to modify these in one place, eh).

     -fixed bug in -L switch that only used last line of SNC file

     -removed -e option (sorry, I got lazy).

     -added -f switch to specify the output data format. Currently
      only SAC and AH are supported.  Had trouble getting correctly
      written SAC data on NT so, for the time being, consider Microsoft
      NT and SAC to be mutually exclusive (AH works fine, but must
      be transferred to Solaris in ascii format to avoid stupid ^M
      characters).

      Still needs to be a bit more friendly if the output directory
      exists (currently we bail).
