IMPORTANT NOTES ABOUT VERSION V3.9
*****************************************************
Background:
Last fall the Earthworm development group began the task of upgrading
Earthworm for Year 2000 compliance.  The first step was to create new
message types for all messages which were using two character years.
This is the most significant change in V3.9.  

********************** VERY IMPORTANT NOTICE **********************

Because some of the message formats have changed in version 3.9 you may
encouter compatibility problems when exchanging data with other
Earthworms running older versions (pre v3.9) or using Earthworm v3.9
output with non-Earthworm programs.

Sites using DOS digitizers will have problems using V3.9 and should contact
Barbara Bogaert for assistance.

********************** VERY IMPORTANT NOTICE **********************


A list of non-Y2K compliant Earthworm message types and the corresponding
Y2K-compliant message types (4-digit years) used in Earthworm v3.9 can be found
in the Release notes included in the V3.9 release. 

V3.9 NEW MODULES:
***************************
decimate: filter and decimate routines supplied by Dave Harris
  to process wave data (TYPE_TRACEBUF) coming from the InRing defined
  in decimate.d into data of type TYPE_DECIMATED which is put to
  the OutRing.  

evansassoc: Y2K-compliant and much enhanced version of trg_assoc (renamed 
  to more clearly indicate its relationship to evanstrig). 
  Partner module to evanstrig, evansassoc associates the single-station
  long period triggers into events.  Evansassoc builds proper TYPE_TRIGLIST2K
  messages (with eventid and author strings) and puts them on a transport
  ring

hyp2000: Y2K-compliant version of hypoinverse.  This is the interactive
  version. 

hyp2000_mgr: Y2K-compliant version of hypoinverse.  This version works in
  the Earthworm eqproc "sausage".  

scream2ew: converts packets from Guralp SCREAM! Server to trace_buf earthworm
messages and puts them into an earthworm ring. Written by Kent  Lindquist
(UofA) and Murray McGowan (Guralp), with minor modifications by Mitch Withers
and Lucky Vidmar.
