Subject: The newbie makes himself known

I appreciate the responses to my recent post concerning mail messages in
earthworm. My name and affiliation :

Andrew M McDermott

I collaborate with Dr. Frank Revetta on the SUNY Potsdam (NY) campus. We
assisted in the installation of a local Earthworm server during the past
weekend (10/15-10/16) by the crew from Lamont-Doherty.

Our server is listed in the DNS server database for 137.143.110.101 
(potsdam.edu) as

worm.potsdam.edu  137.143.104.230

A correction on my question: I quoted the results of "blat -h" as an
indication of the error message which appears on the console from
statmgr when messages are NOT successfuuly sent via my mailserver
(psi.potsdam.edu) to my user (das#0029@psi.potsdam.edu), but I did not
mean to imply that "-h" is issued with blat when it is invoked. I
suspect that if I  knew how blat is being invoked when I set up a mail
entry in statmgr I could probably fix the script/file responsible to
eliminate the error messages. Blat works fine from the command line in
an NT console (I could also find the windows sendmail clones or some
other mail sender but I would still be left with the questions
concerning

1) what is mailed: a file, or a variable holding the error message or...

2) how/where does Earthworm invoke this mailer (since obvously I don't
have a link from blat to /usr/ucb/Mail as the statmgr.d file implies,
yet it seems to look for blat if I don't have it installed)? The
variables included in the file statmgr.d must be included into a
variable which is included in the mailer command invocation somewhere;
in the case of blat, the default values I get in my registry by
installing blat must be overridden in the command line if I need
multiple recipients, etc). 

I have looked around and can't find these things yet. I will keep
looking and screwing around until/unless someone knows this is a
complete waste of time. I figure small things are the best place to
start in understanding how a big thing works. Mail would also make it
simpler for me to monitor this system from a distance, so I figure it
has some value in the early stages.

Thanks again.
