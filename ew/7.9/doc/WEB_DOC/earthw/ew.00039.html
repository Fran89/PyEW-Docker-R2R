Anyone who has run earthworm knows it sends far too many email messages. Often
the solution is to turn off statmgr, the module that controls these
messages. This message discusses the current statmgr and proposes some changes
that may improve things. I discuss only email messages here, although the
problem for paging messages is very similar. Sorry about the length of this
message: it's a confusing topic!

There are two types of messages that statmgr deals with: messages about
modules dying and restarting, and error messages initiated by other
modules. The controls and logic for these two groups of messages are
different.

Module `dead' messages are initiated by statmgr when a module heartbeat does
not arrive by the expected time. Modules send heartbeats at intervals
specified in their config file (the .d file) with a command like
"HeartbeatInt". Statmgr gets the expected heartbeat interval from the module's
.desc file: it's the first number after the "tsec" command.

After issuing the module `dead' message, statmgr may send a module "restart"
message to statmgr. This will happen if the "restartMe" command appears in the
module's .desc file, and if statmgr knows the process ID (pid) of the module
that just died. Statmgr learns module pids from heartbeat messages, so if a
module never sends a heartbeat message before it dies, statmgr will not be
able to have that module restarted.  When a module gets restarted and sends
its heartbeat to statmgr, statmgr will send an "alive" message, to cancel the
previous `dead' message.

The number of `dead' and `alive' messages can be controlled by a parameter in
the .desc file: after the `tsec' command is `mail:' followed by a number. This
is the total number of `dead' and `alive' messages that statmgr will send for
this module. After that number is reached, NO more messages of this type will
be sent until statmgr is restarted.

If a module is unable to keep running (for example, the remote process it
needs to connect to is not running), then statmgr will keep restarting this
module at intervals near to the expected heartbeat interval. This will cause
lots of email messages, log file entries, and general annoyance.

The second type of message is the error message that comes from a module. Each
of these messages is identified by an "err" number, in the module's .desc
file. Also listed in the .desc file for each message are the crypticly labeled
numbers "nerr", "tsec" and "mail". The "mail" number is simple: no more than
this number of messages of this type will ever be sent by statmgr. The "nerr"
and "tsec" message work together to control the rate of messages. If "tsec" is
zero and "nerr" is 1, then every message will be sent. If "nerr" is 2, then
every second message will be sent, etc. 

If "tsec" is some positive number of seconds, then statmgr must receive "nerr"
messages before it will send one mail message. If it gets less than "nerr"
messages in "tsec" seconds, it will not send any email messages of this
type. So if nerr &gt; 1 and tsec &gt; 0, infrequent module messages will never be
sent by email.

Proposed changes:

1. Fix the logic used with "nerr" and "tsec" to control module error
messages. Infrequent messages should always be sent unless the user
intentionally turns them off. For frequent module messages, it should be the
first of a sequence that gets emailed, not some later message.

and: 
2. Change the way the "mail" number controls module messages. Perhaps this
number should be the number of messages allowed per day. At the end of the UTC
day, the counter would get reset to zero.  Then "nerr" and "tsec" would
provide short-term limits on module messages, while the "mail" number would
provide a long-term (24 hours) control. Should the user be able to specify this
long time interval?

and:
3. Change the controls on `dead' and `alive' messages: make the "mail" number
a 24-hour limit as in item 2 above. Should this interval be configurable? This
would limit the amount of email messages about module restarts but would have
no effect on the actual restart schedule.

or:
4. Provide controls on how often a module will be restarted. For example, the
restartMe command could be extended to "restartMe A B C", where A is a number,
and B and C are times in minutes. If a module would be restarted A times in B
minutes, then it gets placed in "slow-restart" mode. Then only one restart
would happen every C minutes. The module would stay in "slow-restart" mode
until it had managed to stay alive for at least C minutes. If the module
proved to be viable, then it would go back on the normal restart schedule as
described above.


Does any of this make any sense? Are there any other ideas or complaints about
statmgr? To minimize traffic on this list, you can send replies to me; I'll
summarize the responses.
