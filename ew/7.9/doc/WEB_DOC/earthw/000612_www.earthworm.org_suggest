Okay so what I'm hearing is that several people have things they
would contribute if they could and have suggestions for the
todo list.  I'm also aware of developments out there that others
may not be.  Plus the contrib needs to be updated.  I propose
that we morph the current Earthworm pages into something more like
a www.earthworm.org.  It should have at least these sections.

1) Current Earthworm pages

2) prominent sign up for earthw-list

3) prominent contrib

4) mechanism to add to contrib

5) 'wish' list of desired functions.

6) 'work in progress' list with names associated with who is taking the
lead on each task and when it is project to be completed.

7) bug reports

8) mechanism to add to the 'work in progress' list

9) wild ones section for the yak grunt processing modules that I referred
   to in my June 7 email.

We all know that Steve Malone doesn't type as fast as he used to
so we will need to either move the current earthworm page or allow
access for a webmaster.  I've dabbled in html so can volunteer
to help with this (hosting and/or helping).  Or we may
wish to pawn this off on earthworm central or the NEIC if they have the
staff to do it.

Then, the web master is going to need a corps of knowledgeable
people that he/she can farm out requests and jobs to
(e.g. John Doe thinks yak grunts should be on the todo list,
what do I do?  or Jane Doe wrote a very cool global associator
who wants to test and check the code?).

More candidates for the todo list include DBMS tools (e.g. ora2seed),
infrastructure applications (e.g. import/export resend capability),
quick dbms linked event review, dbms linked picker/locator revisor,
convenient dbms populater ala dbe.
