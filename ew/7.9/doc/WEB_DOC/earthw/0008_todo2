Subject: todo list


Kudos to Mitch Withers regarding the TODO list pages on the earthworm web
(http://www.cnss.org/EWAB/TODO).  It now has enough stuff to show what is
going on out there and a nice organization to it.   Right-arm!!

And speaking of todo-ing, a few items I might suggest get included on that
list:

  ---- new software under development:

gapsum | Steve Malone | Sep. 2000 | Generate summary tables of gaps in
				    data within waveserver tanks. Maybe some
				    graphics with it.


  ---- Desired new functionality

- waveviewer so it runs on a SUN under X-windows or better yet is a Java
application so it can run on anything.

- Reftek (with PPP interface) monitoring and control that runs on a SUN.

- A graphical control/monitoring module.  (Antelope has a really nice
graphical console that shows all sorts of status info and traces and allows
some control functions)
