Subject: Comments on POSIX compliant earthworm version

     As requested by Steve Malone, here are our comments on Chris
Wood's POSIX compliant version of earthworm.

     We applaud Chris Wood and the USBR for their work in putting
together a POSIX compliant version of earthworm and fixing some bugs
that they discovered in the process.  We don't have any immediate need
for this new version of earthworm at the University of Utah, because
we use Solaris as our main operating system.  Nevertheless, we encourage
the earthworm team to consider adopting the POSIX compliant version of
earthworm as the basis for future releases.  The reduced platform
dependence of the POSIX compliant earthworm code would increase the
number of potential earthworm users and allow all users the flexibility
to choose different operating systems in the future.  And certainly,
any bug fixes are valuable contributions which should be incorporated
into future official versions of earthworm--whether or not the
earthworm team decides to make these versions POSIX compliant.
