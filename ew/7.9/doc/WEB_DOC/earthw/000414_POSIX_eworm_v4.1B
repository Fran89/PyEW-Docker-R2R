Subject: POSIX port of earthworm v4.1B available for testing

For those interested in such things, we ported the Solaris version
of earthworm 4.1B to be POSIX-compliant.  The source is available at:
	ftp://ftp.seismo.usbr.gov/pub/outgoing/v4.1_unix.tar.gz

The code is alpha-level.  It has NOT been extensively tested, but
most modules were tested with the standard test data set, or with some
locally digitized data.  Test parameter files and data are available at:
	ftp://ftp.seismo.usbr.gov/pub/outgoing/run_test_unix.tar.gz

Most Unix vendors claim to be POSIX-compliant, so the code should
run on those systems with few changes.  Of course, vendors sometimes
exaggerate.  The code has currently been tested only on SGI machines.

If anyone is interested in working on validating the code on Solaris
or other POXIX platforms (Linux?), please contact me by email or phone.
I don't have ready access to machines besides HP, SGI, and Linux, but
am willing to work with others who do.

Attached is an updated copy of an announcement handed out at the CNSS
meeting that has some more details.

 -Chris
