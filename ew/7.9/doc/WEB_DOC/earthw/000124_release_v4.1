Subject: Earthworm V4.1 Released

Earthworm Version 4.1 has been released.  

You can download the release from our ftp site:
	ghtftp.cr.usgs.gov:pub/OUTGOING/earthworm/release_v4.1

A New Earthworm_global.d can be found at

A short summary of new developments is given below.  For details of module
enhancements 
and bug fixes, please see the release notes attached to this email or at 
the Earthworm ftp and/or web site.

MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS
********************
sac2hypo:  This program works only under Solaris. It reads the headers
   of all the SAC files in the current directory and creates a 
   Hypoinverse archive file. 

tide2ew:  This program works only under NT. It listens to
   serial line communication from the pucks which collect tide
   data. After NumSamples for an SCN have been collected, a new 
   TYPE_TRACEBUF message is created
   and written to the OutRing stamped with the SCN code given
   in the configuration file.

fir: This module implements a general-purpose FIR filter for
   trace data. Low-pass, high-pass, multi-band-pass and notch filters
   can be specified using simple commands in the configuration file.
   
decimate:  Major revision. Decimate is now a multi-stage filter-decimator.
   The filter coefficients are computed based on the decimation rate, using
   the Remez Exchange algorithm.

wave_serverV/Tools: Three tools: inspect_tank, read_index and read_struct.
   These three tools are to help with problems in wave_serverV tank,
   index and structure files. These are primarily for development work.
  
ring2sac: Writes continuous sac files given a list of Station, Component,
   Network names.  This software is contributed by University of Utah 
   Seismograph Station.  

trig2disk/waveman2disk:  Both modules can create SAC format file running under 
   NT andcreate PCSUDS format files under NT.

EARTHWORM DOCUMENTATION
******************************
The Earthworm web site has been upgraded to be consistent with
Version 4.1. 

CONTRIBUTED SOFTWARE
********************
Many Earthworm modules have been developed at regional networks to meet 
their specific needs.  Since some of these may be useful to other 
networks, we make these available at the Earthworm ftp site in the 
Contributed_software directory.  Currently, you will find modules 
developed at USGS Menlo Park, University of Memphis,  University of 
Washington and University of Alaska, Fairbanks.

If you have questions or comments, please contact me at 
bogaert@usgs.gov.
