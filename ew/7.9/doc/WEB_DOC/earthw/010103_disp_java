Subject: Java applet for displaying waveform

    [ The following text is in the "iso-8859-1" character set. ]
    [ Your display is set for the "US-ASCII" character set.  ]

We are in the process of having a college intern create a java program that
will display real-time output on any generic computer with Internet access.
The intent is to allow general access to the datastream while away from the
earthworm site and for public affairs.  Most likely, he will be programming
a server program in NT or in C++ to run in Linux to accept a generic_export
stream from the earthworm system and then allow the java programs to stream
the data from the server program.

If anyone has done this or is currently working on this, your help and / or
insight would be greatly appreciated.
