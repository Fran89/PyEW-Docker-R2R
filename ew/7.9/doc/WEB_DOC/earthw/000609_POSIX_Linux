Subject: POSIX ew

I reported as soon as 19 or 20 th of april my success in installing
the Chris Wood's port on Linux Intel machine (directly to Chris and not
to the list). Since it seems to interrest more people I report it to
the list now.

Concerning the discussion of the last days, I can understand how difficult
it is to keep coherency in the developpement of such a rich collection
of codes as ew.  For ad hoc purpose, I wrote and modified several modules
but in a way which is not "ew clean" and wich are not ready to be
released to the communauty. Amoung the things which are of interrest for me:
Physical parametrization of the picker (removing hard coded references
to 100hz sampling rate).

Another back end to the eqproc suite (more adequate to volcanic networks
where the difference of altitude is of the same order as the distance
between stations).  All that requires a lot of testing and once it works,
it is useless without a proper documentation which is not the easiest part.
