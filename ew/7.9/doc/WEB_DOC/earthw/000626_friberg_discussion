Subject: recent discussions

Dear EW community,

We are new to the ewlist proper and just did a read 
through of the last years worth of discussions.
The recent discussions about POSIX and the need for
an improved contribution mechanism have been very
interesting. We applaud Chris and company for their
efforts in bringing POSIX standards to EW and hope
that it gets adopted into the regular release. We also
hope a more standard approach to contributions is 
established.

On the contribution discussion, we were surprised to
hear that Kent has written a continuous data archiver
and it never made it into the release. When will this make
it into the release? 

ISTI has made a few modifications to waveman2disk, including
some bug fixes. We would like to contribute our work back to
the official release. The version we have uses the Berkeley
qlib2 to provide mseed output. We were not contracted by
anyone to write this. Furthermore, we have not been contracted, 
at this time, to write a separate waveserver client that does 
continous data archiving to miniseed (referred to as ew2mseed 
in some emails I saw on the archive). Is there still community
interest in such a client, or will our waveman2disk mods suffice?

Regards,

Paul
