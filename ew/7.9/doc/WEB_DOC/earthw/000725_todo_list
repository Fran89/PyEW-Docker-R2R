Subject: todo list


Hi all:

As a first pass, I have put a table on the EWAB web page hoping
to make a todo list.  This is an effort to avoid duplication
of effort and provide an opportunity to take on tasks.  Take
a look and tell me what additional fields should be in there,
and help me fill out the table with what everyone is working on.

thanks,
