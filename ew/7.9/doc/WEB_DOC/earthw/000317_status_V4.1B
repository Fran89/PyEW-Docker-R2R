Earthworm Status Report

V4.1 Patch B
************
Earthworm V4.1 patch B has been released.  It fixes a bug in trig2disk. The
problem was that SAC files would not be written correctly when running on NT.
The Patch can be retrieved from the Earthworm ftp site:
ghtftp.cr.usgs.gov:pub/OUTGOING/earthworm/release_v4.1B


New Modules:
************
The following modules will be released as part of Earthworm V5.  Earthworm V5
will be released in April 2000.

LISS2EW:
Liss2ew is the earthworm module for receiving trace data from the Live Internet
Seismic Server. The LISS is a protocol that provides trace data in mini-SEED
format in near-real-time over an IP link. The liss2ew module will connect to
one LISS, read selected streams of trace data, and write that trace data into
the earthworm transport ring. 

EW2LISS:
Ew2liss is the Earthworm module for serving Earthworm trace data in LISS (Live
Internet Seismic Server) format. The ew2liss module will convert selected SCNs
(station-component-network) of trace data from an Earthworm transport ring,
convert that data to miniSEED format, and serve the data to a single LISS
client (such as liss2ew) over a IP network connection. 

On-going Developments
********************
Kinemetrics K2 Integration:
A suite of modules is being developed for inputting continuous waveform and SOH
data from a Kinemetrics K2 data logger into the Earthworm system.  These module
are based on code developed by ISTI under contact to the USGS.  The modules
will be able to run under NT and Solaris, and receive data either over a serial
link to the K2 or over an IP link via the host machines network connection and
a IP-terminal server connected to the K2.   Completion is expected before the
end of May.

Mini-seed archiver:
Lamont-Doherty Cooperative Seismographic Network has contracted with ISTI to
develop a module, ew2mseed,  which will be capable of writing continuos
mini-seed files for archiving and distribution.

DBMS
*****
Starting with the release of Earthworm v5 in April 2000, Earthworm will contain
an OPTIONAL Server Package. This server currently consists of an Oracle DBMS
(Standard Edition), a web server, and a map server. The initial suite of
functions of this server are fairly minimal, but the idea is that the
infrastructure is in place, and we will be in position to produce additional
capabilities relatively rapidly.
                Note that the Server Package is not required to run the
Earthworm system. If no DBMS server is available, all Earthworm functions will
continue to operate as before, and will be supported and enhanced as before.
There will, however, be a growing suite of features which will be available
only if a Server is available.

The initial set of DBMS-based server features, available in Earthworm v5, are:

        * The DBMS is presumed to be a network-based service. That is, the DBMS
server may reside in the local Earthworm computer, in another computer at the
installation, or at a remote site. 

        * All event data, both parametric and waveform, known to the local
Earthworm system can be loaded into the agreed-upon DBMS servers as it is
computed (or received).

        * An Earthworm system can send real-time data to any number of DBMS
servers (local or distant).

        * A DBMS server can accept real-time data from any number of Earthworm
(or other) systems.

        * A DBMS server can support any number of concurrent, authorized
clients.

        * All data feeds from a local Earthworm system to any DBMS servers are
under exclusive control of the local Earthworm configuration.

        * The DBMS server supports a web site offering 'real-time', interactive
seismicity maps. The maps, and the associated pages, provide graphic access to
event, trace, and station data in the DBMS.

        * Event and station data, including instrument response, can be pushed
to a browser client in SAC format. Other formats will be incorporated.

        * Re-analysis of events using SAC and re-insertion of updated events
into the Database.  SAC will be augmented with other analysis tools, including
Jiggle (as developed at USGS, Pasadena ). 

        * Archiving of parametric and waveform data.

        * Manual event creation. This permits an authorized user to declare an
event location and radius of interest. The server will then search for all
available stations within the specified radius, acquire the relevant portions
of trace data, and insert them into the DBMS.
