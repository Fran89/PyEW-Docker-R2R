Ali,
	Sorry about the delay getting back to you.  Yes, we are running the
"k2ew" code over an IP link using an MSS100 terminal server.  It is working
(mostly).  Pete Lombard (living in Berkeley and consulting for USGS and us
<lombard@geophys.washington.edu>) is the current developer of this code and
would be the best to provide it to you directly.  Of course, one would hope
that a central FTP site would have such development code available to anyone
who wanted to test it, but for now check with Pete.

Ali,

The K2EW software is currently available on the machine gldrocky at Golden
in working directory. You have an account on that system.  If you have any
problems accessing the software, let me know.

The K2EW software has been made available to the participants of the USGS
Strong Motion Urban Upgrade Project (NCSN, PNSN, UUSN).  Since it is  not
fully tested I have not made it available via the Earthworm ftp site.
However, if anyone is interested in using the development version, please
contact me at bogaert@usgs.gov.

- Barbara
