Subject: new module


We're developing a new module that's not a module and seek suggestions
from the community on specifications.  While tempting to have it do
what I want, when I want, without knowing what I want when, this isn't
very realistic.

Earthworm version 5.1 will include a quick review mechanism that allows
repicking and relocating if a database is available.  It is not yet
intended to replace existing review mechanism but rather is designed
for responding to significant events.  The new module will be www
based and provides the means to do what needs doin after you review
the event.  Potential functionality might include:

create and pretty report suitable for distributing to media, ema, etc
via fax, email and web.

Search a list of people to notify and provide parameters to produce a
appropriate list of people to notify for this particular event (e.g. don't want
to notify North Dakota about an event in Florida).

Ding a cube system

Update qdds

Update finger

Tell Waverly and make sure NEIC and local magnitudes aren't completely different.

I wonder if we can get it to automagically deploy an aftershock array.

password protect it

make it hard to break by a groggy operator at 2AM, think microsoft and ask me
to verify things.  let me go back and undo things.

Please email your ideas directly to me or the earthw-list.

thanks,

Mitch
