Subject: trig2disk


CERI has recently completed a beta version of a new earthworm module
called trig2disk.  It listens for type_triglist message (e.g those
produced by arc2trig and by carltrig), grabs appropriate data segments
from wave_serverV, and writes the waveforms to disk in either sac
or ah_xdr format.  Version 3.3 of carltrig, parse_trig, and arc2trig
are required (i.e. needs the author field in the event line).  It
has been tested under sparc/solaris and intel/NT.  It is available
from the developement machine at golden in working/src/trig2disk.
I can also supply it from Memphis, but please email me for it
so I can help with the v3.3 modifications.  Questions concerning
the NT port should be directed to Alex, since I've had my fill of
NT and he's in love with it.
