Subject: Re: Suggested Picker Parameter Changes


Thanks Jim.  That really helps.  I went to even greater extremes and sacrificed
a lag in the pick times for a smoother sta/lta and set c3 and c4 to
0.02 and 0.002 respectively (the MS embayment is very noisy) for 1 second and
10 second windows.  I used the philosophy that these are auto-locations anyway
so what's a second of static origin time offset amongst friends.  If other
things don't go wrong, we're still able to get auto-locs to within a few
to ten kilometers of the reviewed location.

In New Mexico we found 0.25 second short windows and 2 second long windows to be
reasonable on a non-earthworm system.  For global data 3 seconds/24 seconds might
be more appropriate.
