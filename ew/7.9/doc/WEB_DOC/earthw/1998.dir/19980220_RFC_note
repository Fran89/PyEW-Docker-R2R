Subject: Earthworm News

Dear Earthwormers:

The EarthWorm Advisory Board (EWAB) has set up a procedure to solicit
comments from the community regarding development plans.  This will be
done through both an e-mail list-server and a WEB page under the general
EWAB set of WEB pages.  You are being added to this e-mail list.  Any
comments regarding Earthworm development can be sent to this list.
However, we have set up a procedure (already popular in the Internet
development community) called a `Request For Comments' (RFC).  Someone
developing a new module for Earthworm is advised to write a RFC and post
it to this list to solicit comments specific to that module.  This will
help coordinate development and should result in modules that are of more
general use.  There are currently already three RFCs posted on the WEB.

However, any comments of possible interest to the Earthworm community
should be sent to this list related to an RFC or not.

The WEB address for RFCs is:
	http://www.cnss.org/EWAB/RFC

The e-mail list server address for comments is:
	earthw-list@nmt.edu

If you want to Unsubscribe to this list (or re subscribe) send e-mail to:
	majordomo@nmt.edu
containing in the body of the message the text:
	unsubscribe earthw-list
or
	subscribe earthw-list

(Your return address on this e-mail message should be yours and must be
valid for this to work)


and here is the list to whom I will send the above note and who will be
signed up on the list soon.  Please let me know if you can think of anyone
I should add to this:

	Steve Malone
	EWAB WEB Manager
