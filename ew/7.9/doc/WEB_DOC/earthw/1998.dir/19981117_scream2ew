Subject: new module


A new module is available.  It was written by Kent Lindquist and Murray McGowan
and sponsored by DTA.  I made it v4.0 compliant (though haven't tested this
rigourously).

It listens for GCF format messages from SCREAM!, converts to trace_buf, and
puts em on the wave_ring.  (SCREAM! is the NT interface to the Guralp
digitizers.)  Scream2ew is available in the workingY2K directory on the earthworm
development machine.  Be warned of the relatively large message lengths:
Tank MPH4 BHE UM 2068 INST_MEMPHIS MOD_WILDCARD 256 10000 /dat4/mph4_bhe.tnk

I have also written a program to convert from a directory of ah_xdr format
waveform files, to a file in trace_buf format suitable for playing through
tankplayer.  It currently requires all data files to have the same sample
rate, start times, and end times.  It is available in the UM directory
on the earthworm development machine.
