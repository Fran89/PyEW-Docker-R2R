Subject: Earthworm documentation and other comments


Dear fellow worms:
	Several things:

   1. With the latest release of v3.1 a tar of the directory tree of HTML
documents was provided on the gldage.cr.usgs.gov machine's anonymous FTP.
The original documents were not totally compatible with relocating them on
a different server or in a file based way.  This has now been fixed and
several documents updated as well.  Also, a procedure has been set up to
routinely make the lastest version of the document tar every week.  This
new documentation tree is located on anonymous FTP at:
	ftp://ftp.geophys.washington.edu/pub/out/earthworm.doc.tar

If you got a previous version of this tree I recommend that you get this
latest one and plan to update that fairly often.

    2. For those updating their running earthworm to v3.1 please realise
that the format of the station configuration file for the picker,
"pick_ew.sta" has changed.  The new picker will run fine with the old
format but will NOT produce picks.  See the latest documents.

    3. Also, with the v3.1 distribution there were several contributed
programs from groups other than the core USGS earthworm bunch which should
have been included and were not.  The core USGS group is working out a way
to easily provide for `contributed' software (from us non-feds out in
the back woods) to be easily available on their server.  If you have ideas
or suggestions about how to do this, send them to Barbara Bogaert at
bogaert@gldage.cr.usgs.gov.
