Subject: EARTHWORM Documentation ready for release


Dear EWAB,
	It seems the earthworm development team got the message and has
generated a start at documentation.  Barbara and Lyn sent me a set of
documents a week or so ago and Pete Lombard helped me put them together
into a set of WEB pages.  While the set of documents is not complete, it
is a good start and should provide some help to those needing either basic
`what is earthworm' information, to some nitty gritty internals.  There
are vast sections on EARTHWORM operations which are still missing, but I
am assured that they will be forthcoming in a reasonable time. 

	Also, included in this package is a start at an inventory about
what is at other earthworm sites (Thanks Sue and Lyn).

Please take a look at these documents; scan through them and see if they
are not a start.  Let me know if there are important changes needed before
these are released to the general CNSS community.  If any of you feel
major changes are needed, just grab the source file, edit it and return it
to me via e-mail and I will try to get it fix.  Minor changes can just be
sent as patches in e-mail.
	Also, if you are running a version of earthworm, please make a
`site' page for the inventory/sites pages.  The best thing to do is grab a
copy of an existing one (the UofUtah is one of the best) and edit that.
Please use the same layout and style so its easy for people to see what is
running where.

OK....  You will find it all at URL:
	http://www.cnss.org/EWAB/toc.html

Note that this is not linked into any public pages yet,, but I want to do
that be the end of this week and send out e-mail about it to the cnss
mailing list.
