Subject: Release of Earthworm V3.2

Earthworm Version 3.2 has been released.  

WHERE TO GET IT:

Our ftp site at gldage.cr.usgs.gov:pub/OUTGOING/earthworm.


FEATURES OF V3.2

New convention:

Originally, the entire earthworm.d configuration file was
installation-specific.  However, we have discoverd that networks sharing
data need to use the same naming convention for certain message_types.

To facilitate this process, the Earthworm Development Group has defined
a group of reserved message_types as follows:

   0- 99 are reserved by "Earthworm Central" to label types of messages
         which may be exchanged between installations. These string/value
         mappings must be global to all Earthworm systems.

 100-255 are controlled by each Earthworm installation. These values 
         should be used to label messages which remain internal to 
         an Earthworm system or installation.

New Modules:

evanstrig:  
This module is actually an adaptation of lptrig. Evanstrig runs John
Evans' long-period trigger algorithm on single-channel TYPE_TRACEBUF
messages and produces single-channel triggers.  These triggers can then
be associated into "events" by the module trg_assoc.

carlstatrig/carlsubtrig: 
The Carl Johnson coincidence trigger. Carlstatrig reads tracedata,
calculates station averages and writes station trigger messages to a
transport ring. Carlsubtrig reads station trigger messages from one or
more carlstatrig modules, performs subnet coincidence logic, and writes
a TRIGLIST message. Carlsubtrig can be configured to allow for station
latency due to telemetry delays.

Compress_UA and Decompress_UA:
The compress_UA and decompress_UA modules implement the gencompress
algorithm  which is used with permission from Boulder Real Time
Technologies, Inc., copyright 1997.
