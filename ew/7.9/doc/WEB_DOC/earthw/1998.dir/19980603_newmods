Subject: New earthworm modules available, earth2sac and carltrig


Earthwormers may be interested that there are now two new modules
available to help with the `back-end' of earthworm (triggering and
saving waveform data for manual analysis).

earth2sac - This program produces SAC-format data files from data
originating from wave_serverV sources. It only fills in the SAC headers
relevant to the trace data itself at this point.  Adapted from the program
'earth2uw' by Pete Lombard.

carl_trig - The Carl Johnson coincidence trigger for Earthworm consists of
two programs. CarlStaTrig produces station trigger messages on a transport
ring. CarlSubTrig reads these and writes a TRIGLIST message to a transport
ring and/or produces a psudo-pickfile for use by data extraction routines
such as 'earth2sac'.  These two programs were written by Pete Lombard and
Brian Moon. 

Both of these programs have only been thoroughly tested on Solaris-2.x at
the University of Washington.  Documentation is available on the Earthworm
WEB pages (http://www.cnss.org/EWAB) and the distributions are available
in the contribed_software part of the Earthworm FTP site 
(ftp://gldage.cr.usgs.gov/pub/OUTGOING/earthworm).
