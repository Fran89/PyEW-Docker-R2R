Alex and Barbara have just relocated to Golden. They're setting up their 
offices, phones, and computers. They expect to spend considerable time in Menlo 
Park and other regional network sites as required. Among their assignments are 
to assist with the NOAA-USGS tsunami effort and to package and support 
Earthworm for use by regional networks.
<P>
Recent work by the Earthworm team have been driven by the requirements of the 
NOAA-USGS tsunami upgrade effort and by the SF Bay Area developments: 

<H3>CURRENT DIRECTIONS:</H3>
<B>1. Interface to interactive analysis codes:</B>
We have been directed to expand Earthworm from its original "stand alone" 
rapid notification function. We have thus been working on interface modules to 
existing post-processing systems. We have completed an integration with the 
existing system at the Alaska Tsunami Warning Center (ATWC), and are currently 
working on an interface to SAC. The objective of the SAC integration is to 
produce a fairly general interface, such that other formats can be easily 
created. IceWorm, of course, has been successfully interfaced to DataScope for 
some time.
<P>
<B>2. Data base:</B>
Our involvement with data base management systems (DBMS) was driven by the 
SF Bay Area rapid notification requirements: It is expected that several 
institutions will contribute a variety of trace and parametric data seconds to 
hours after an event, and that a variety of users will have to be served, 
ranging from seismologists wishing to review and edit event parameters, 
sophisticated clients requiring geographical data to drive damage prediction 
models, as well as public and press inquiries.
We have evaluated several DBMS's, and have chose Oracle. To date, we have 
demonstrated a system which automatically inserts parametric and associated 
trace data segments into a remote DBMS server machine within seconds of event 
detection, and which retrieves trace data on request. Data base tables are 
visible in real-time via a standard web browser. 
Our current plan is to have the DBMS as an optional layer between Earthworm 
and a post-processing system: We're working on a set of modules which insert 
real-time Earthworm data into the DBMS, and programs which retrieve data from 
the DBMS and create files in various formats. An alternate set of modules 
(really a subset of the above), creates such files directly. 
We have skirted the issue of schemas. We are currently using a temporary 
trash schema to develop basic functions and make performance measurements. The 
DBMS permits considerable flexibility in creating new schemas, modifying 
existing ones, and presenting various external views of internal schemas. It 
thus appears that we will be able to accommodate various schemas as they are 
suggested to us.
<P>
<B>3. Operating Systems:</B>
We are trying to follow Carl's edict of platform independence. In practice, 
we 1)try to use as few operating system features as possible, 2) keep system-
specific functions in a library of wrappers, and write a library of such 
wrappers for each operating system. Thus, substituting the library at load time 
will permit a complying module to migrate across operating systems. 3) There is 
also a set of modules which are hopelessly system specific, either by their 
nature, or because they contain sacred legacy code. The intent there is to 
either produce system specific versions, or toward making them system 
independent. 
Our aim has been to stay viable on Sun and Intel platforms. Earthworm 
currently runs on Solaris, OS/2, and NT. We anticipate abandoning OS/2 (with 
great sadness) as it seems to unable be dying, most notably from a lack of 
drivers for contemporary adapter cards. The NT port is completed and tested. 
Our current thinking is to stay with Solaris (of course!) and NT. 
<P>
<B>4. Connectivity:</B>
Earthworm currently offers several mechanisms for data exchange: 
Two modules (Import/Export) permit real-time exchange of data between 
distant systems. This includes any of the messages flowing within an Earthworm 
system: trace data, phase picks, hypocentral summaries, trigger messages, etc. 
The objectives are robustness, protection from overload, recovery from 
disruptions, and security. Links can be established only after both parties 
have agreed to the exchange, and have created matching configurations. 
Currently, this mechanism is used to send picks from Menlo to the Pasadena CUSP 
system and hypocenters and trace from Menlo to ATWC. 
<P>
WaveServer offers a mechanism for the exchange of trace data out of real 
time. Offers internet-wide TCP service of trace data from within a few
seconds of real-time to several days ago. See below.
VDL (of USNSN) fame has been implemented as a module (Solaris only) of 
Earthworm and has performed well. RCV, capable of moving triggered data from 
USNSN to a local Earthworm is about to be implemented. Several RCV 
implementations have been done (ATWC, Reno), but more work seems to be needed 
to have a production-quality module.
The proposed DBMS integration may provide yet another mechanism via DBMS 
to DBMS replication.

<H3>RECENT DEVELOPMENTS:</H3>

<B>WaveServerIV:</B>
This module has undergone several revisions, including significant 
contributions by Kent Lindquist at UofA Fairbanks. This version includes much 
effort aimed toward robustness and error handling. It has been in production at 
Menlo Park for several months, and appears to be reliable. It listens to 
specific channels of trace data within a local Earthworm, and maintains 
circular disk files (up to 2Gb) for each channel. It allows variable telemetry
block lengths, handles intermittent data without wasting memory, and offers 
rapid restarts. 
<P>
It offers a multithreaded server, which supports a documented dialog. 
Basically, the dialog permits a client to learn what the WaveServer knows 
currently, and to ask the WaveServer for trace data in either raw or ASCII
form. The raw mode returns the exact packets received, while the ASCII mode
produces a `sanitized' time series suitable for immediate display. A suite of 
client utility routines have been written (in C) to facilitate writing client 
programs.
<P>
It can be configured to serve a maximum number of concurrent clients to 
prevent overloading the client machine.
<P>
<B>WaveViewer:</B>
This program was written by Carl Johnson to provide an electronic develocorder 
for the Volcano program at Menlo Park. It operates as a client to WaveServer 
(above), and can connect to any WaveViewer on the Internet. It offers general 
trace browsing to within a few seconds of real-time, as well as event-by-event 
viewing of triggers specified by a detector module. It is written in C++ and is 
GUI- and graphics-oriented. It is thus not system independent (Carl!), but runs 
on Windows95 and NT only.
<P>
<B>Trigger messages:</B>
We have created a new message type (TYPE_TRIG). This evolved from our 
efforts in support of the Mammoth Mt. volcanic monitoring at Menlo Park. This 
message is ASCII, very readable, and gives an event id, an event start time, 
and a list of participating station names, station trigger times, and start 
time and duration of the `interesting' portion of data. 
Currently, there are two sources of such messages: the John Evans 
volcanic long-period event detector, and arc2trig (below), which is driven by a 
hypo- inverse `arc' message. We are schedules to port the Carl Johnson STA/LTA 
coincidence trigger into this scheme as well.
<P>
<B>arc2trig:</B>
This module listens for hypo-arc messages from hypoinverse, and produces 
trigger messages.
<P>
<B>dbreport:</B>
Listens for hypo-arc messages and stuffs the parametric information into a 
trial schema on a remote Oracle DBMS server machine.
<P>
<B>dbtrace_save:</B>
Listens for trigger messages, and stuffs the specified trace data snippets and 
associated information into a remote Oracle DBMS server machine. Trace data is 
obtained from WaveServers in raw format. This module can be configured with a 
list of known WaveServers (anywhere in the Internet), and will access any of 
the WaveServers to obtain the trace data specified in the trigger message.
<P>
<B>dbtrace_get:</B>
Given an event id (interactively for now), retrieves all associated trace data 
snippets from the DBMS, and creates a directory containing flat files 
containing the trace data. It is designed to have a replaceable back-end for 
accommodating various formats.
<P>
<B>fftrace_save: </B>
A combination of the two modules above, which does not use the DBMS, but goes 
directly from earthworm messages and WaveServers to event files in various 
formats.
<P>
<B>A/D NT:</B>
We have ported the digitizer module to NT. The original module was DOS based, 
required it's own machine, and produced multiplexed data. This version produces 
the standard internal Earthworm demultiplexed format, can co-exist with other 
modules in one NT box, and uses contemporary National Instruments hardware. A/D 
triggering is either via an on-bard crystal clock or external pulses. Uses the 
same multiplexers as the original DOS version.

<H3>FUTURE DIRECTIONS:</H3>

<B>Packaging Earthworm:</B>
In response to the August 25th letter from the Earthworm Advisory Board, a 
project is being launched to document and package Earthworm to provide an 
overview, and to ease installation, operation, and modifications.
<P>
It has been suggested that we work on making it easier to 1) understand 
what Earthworm is in general, 2) what is currently available, and 3) how to 
install and configure. A meeting of interested people has been scheduled to 
establish a working group. The intent is to work closely with CNSS by seeking 
out suggestions, and announcing our progress via the CNSS list-server, and 
other means as appropriate. 
<P>
<B>Support:</B>
Develop a group of people at various institutions who can provide support at 
various levels.
<P>
<B>Integration with Post-processing systems:</B>
Complete current work leading to integration with interactive analysis and 
archive packages. Initial targets are SAC and the UofW system.
<P>
<B>DBMS:</B>
Continue on the Earthworm - DBMS - Postprocessing System integration. Keep the 
DBMS as an optional layer, such that it can be inserted or removed with minimal 
disruption. Work toward a Postprocessing to DBMS interface, allowing manually 
generated parametric data to be inserted into the DBMS. Explore DBMS-based 
products, such as GIS layers, web servers, etc.
