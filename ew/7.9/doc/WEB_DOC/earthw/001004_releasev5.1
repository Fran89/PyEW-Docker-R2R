10/4/00

V5.1 Is Released
****************
It can be retrieved from the Earthworm ftp site
ghtftp.cr.usgs.gov/pub/OUTGOING/earthworm/release_v5.1

New Features of EW V5.1
***********************
k2ew: Communicates with the K2 data logger from Kinemetrics. Uses TCP or 
COM port for communication on WindowsNT, TCP or TTY (serial) comms on Unix. 
See src/data/sources/k2ew/Doc or the Earthworm web pages for documentation.

ringdup: Program to read messages (with user given logos) from one ring and 
deposit them in another. This is mainly copied
from export. This is actually two programs: ringdup_generic and ringdup_scn.

naqs2ew: Interfaces with the Nanometrics digital data acquisition program, 
NaqsServer, requests continuous waveform data
from a list of SCNs and outputs Earthworm tracebuf packets into an 
Earthworm transport ring.

Event Review Using the Earthworm Database: The Event Review provides 
Earthworm with a remote, rapid event review
capability. Its intended use is permit a duty seismologist to rapidly 
respond to a significant event. It was NOT designed to
serve as a routine analysis facility.

CONTRIBUTED SOFTWARE

The contributed software can be found at

Coming Soon: A table describing contributed software can be found at URL:

UNIVERSITY OF UTAH SEISMIC STATION:
IMPORT_GEN_PASV/EXPORT_ACTV: The original Earthworm import/export pair have 
been modified such that import_generic is now passive and the export 
modules now initiates communication. import_gen_pasv module prepares a port 
and waits for a connection request from a export_actv module. These modules 
will become part of the core Earthworm in release v5.2.
