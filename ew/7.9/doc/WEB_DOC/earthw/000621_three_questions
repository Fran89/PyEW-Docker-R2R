Subject: Three questions for al earthwormers


I have three problems/questions maybe someone out there can help with:

1. A way to get state-of-health from refteks using PPP with a 422 card and
rtpd. In particular we need to know if the GPS clock is locking when it
should.  Right now we have no way of knowing this info without visiting the
site.

2. Some reasonable way to reconfigure waveservers to change paramters, add
channels, remove channels without stoping and starting the entire system. With
lots of new stations being installed and our earthworm having lots of
inport/export modules its a big long dance for it to shut down everything and
come back up everytime a small configuration change needs to be made. Not very
robust, no?
   Also, on the same topic, waveserver can gets its butt in a ringer if one
tries to change channel parameters on it, even removing those tank files, and
even if the "ReCreateBadTanks" variable is set.  It will sometimes get so
tangled that it either keeps crashing or if it does run it throws out some
channels.  The only solution seems to be to remove ALL tanks and start from
scratch.

3. A mini-seed wirter.  Notes from Alex back in winter said something about
Lamont contracting for a ew2mseed module.  No word about this since then.  
Actually, much better for us than a earthworm module that needs to sit on the
WAVE_RING would be a stand-alone program to yank traces from waveservers and
write mseed files.  Any one have such?
