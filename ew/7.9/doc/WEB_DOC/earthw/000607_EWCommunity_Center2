Hello,

We had the same problem, so in 1995 I wrote a module called css_report
to solve this. The css_report module stores parametric and segmented
waveform data in CSS format. In 1996 I wrote a companion module called
archiver which stores all continuous waveform data in both CSS and
optionally AH or SAC format. I submitted both of these to the earthworm
team on several occasions from 1995 onwards, keeping the modules up to
date with the latest earthworm releases. Perhaps these modules would
help you meet your needs.

Good luck,
Kent
