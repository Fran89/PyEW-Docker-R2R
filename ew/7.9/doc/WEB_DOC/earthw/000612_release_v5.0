New Features of EW V5.0
***********************
Earthworm v5.0 contains an OPTIONAL Server Package. This server consists of:
        *  a DBMS Server (Oracle v8, Standard Edition), 
        *  a web server (Apache), and 
        *  a map server (based on GMT). 
The initial suite of functions of this server are fairly minimal, but the idea
is that the infrastructure is in place, and we will be in good position to
produce additional capabilities.
                Note that the Server Package is not required to run the
Earthworm system. If no DBMS server is available, all Earthworm functions will
continue to operate as before, and will be supported and enhanced as before.
There will, however, be a growing suite of features which will be available
only if a Server is available.

The initial set of DBMS-based server features are:
        * The DBMS is presumed to be a network-based service. That is, the DBMS
server may reside in the local Earthworm computer, in another computer at the
installation, or at a remote site. 
        * All event data, both parametric and waveform, known to the local
Earthworm system can be loaded into the agreed-upon DBMS servers as it is
computed (or received).
        * An Earthworm system can send and/or accept real-time data to/from any
number of DBMS servers (local or distant).
        * A DBMS server can support any number of concurrent, authorized
clients.
        * All data feeds from a local Earthworm system to any DBMS servers are
under exclusive control of the local Earthworm configuration.
        * The DBMS server supports a web site offering rapid-response,
interactive seismicity maps. The maps, and the associated pages, provide
graphic access to event, trace, and station data in the DBMS.
        * Event and station data, including instrument response, can be pushed
to a browser client in SAC format. Other formats will be incorporated.
        * Archiving of parametric and waveform data.

For additional information about the Server Package, or for installation
assistance, please contact me.

OTHER NEW MODULES
*****************

LISS2EW
Liss2ew is the earthworm module for receiving trace data from the Live Internet
Seismic Server. The LISS is a protocol that provides trace data in mini-SEED
format in near-real-time over an IP link. The liss2ew module will connect to
one LISS, read selected streams of trace data, and write that trace data into
the earthworm transport ring. 

EW2LISS
Ew2liss is the Earthworm module for serving Earthworm trace data in LISS (Live
Internet Seismic Server) format. The ew2liss module will convert selected SCNs
(station-component-network) of trace data from an Earthworm transport ring,
convert that data to miniSEED format, and serve the data to a single LISS
client (such as liss2ew) over a IP network connection. 


CONTRIBUTED SOFTWARE
**************************

The contributed software can be found at 
        ghtftp.cr.usgs.gov/pub/OUTGOING/earthworm/release_v5.0

UNIVERSITY OF UTAH:
REFTOEW: Reftoew collects data from a UNR RefTek Data Server, a disk file or
an  Earthworm transport ring.  The data (DT) packets are forwarded to the
Earthworm Transport layer as TRACE_BUF format packets and optionally written to
disk as binary SAC files.

VOLCANO PROGRAM:
The wonderful people at CVO have modified Carlsubtrig, Trig2disk,
Heli_standalone, and Sgram for the greater flexibility required in the volcano
networks.

CARLSUBTRIG: Many new options regarding how subnets are triggered and which
stations are saved.

TRIG2DISK:  Functions Putaway.c SudsPutaway.c and AhPutaway.c were modified to
use the named subnets now supplied by Carlsubtrig in naming the directories.

HELI_STANDALONE:  Ported to NT. 

SGRAM: Ported to NT. 

In addition, an NT-based Earthworm interface has been developed by CVO, which
replaces startstop, statmgr, and provides a GUI interface to various Earthworm
functions.
