Steve,

There are three `size' values in wave_server's config file. The first is the
record size. This is the amount of space alloted for a single trace_buf
message. It has to be a fixed size to allow the indexing to work.

A trace_buf message consists of 64 bytes of header and then an arbitrary
number of binary numbers: 2 or 4 byte integers. For a reftek packet, there are
250 4-byte samples in one packet, for a total of 1064 bytes. The number used
at UW of 1100 is sufficient to hold 1064, with a little wasted space. The k2ew
packets contain 100 4-byte samples, for a total size of 464 bytes. So the
record size can be 464 or larger. By using 1100, you are wasting a lot of
space. 

The next `size' is the file size, the total number of bytes in the tank
file. Wave server takes this number and divides by the record size to get the
number of trace_buf packets that can be held in the tank. Note that while the
label in wave_server.d says `megabytes', it means 10^6, not 2^20.

The final `size' value is the index size. This is the number of index entries
that wil be kept in the index files. Every time there is a gap of more than
GapThresh times the sample interval, a new index entry is needed. When a gap
in the data is overwritten by the tank wrapping around, the old index entry is
dropped from memory.

In looking over wave_server code, I found one feature you could use to make
config changes more easily. There is a flag `ReCreateBadTanks' toward the
bottom of the config file. Currently it is commented out. If you set its value
to 1, then the wave_server will create a new tank if it can't find an old one
and it is listed in the config file. This is slightly dangerous, since it may
overwrite an existing tank if it has some error trying to read it. But that
should be a pretty rare occurrence. 

The logic is a little convoluted, so perhaps I should explain the sequence
that wave_server goes through on startup. It reads the config file, and then
it reads the `tank structure' file (the *.str file). It assumes that the tank
structure file has the most up-to-date information about existing tank files
(*.tnk) and their indexes (*.inx), especially tank file size, record size, and
tank starting position. It runs through the list of tanks from the structure
file, verifies that that SCN is listed in the config file, and tries to open
the tank file and its index. This is why simply changing size parameters in
the config file (without deleting the tank and indexes) has no effect: the
size information is read from the structure file as long as a matching SCN is
found from the config file.

If the tank and index files are read successfully, then that tank is marked as
OK. If there are errors opening these files, then one of two things happens. If
ReCreateBadTanks is not set, then the tank is marked as BAD and removed from
the internal list. Otherwise, the tank is marked as unconfigured and left for
the next step.

So this first part of the initialization has been running through the list of
tanks found in the tank structure file, making sure that each SCN is still
listed in the config file. For the second part, the list from the config file
is scanned. In most cases, the tank will already have been configured because
it was an existing tank and listed in the structure file. But if you add new
SCNs to the config file, these must be created anew. Here is where the
ReCreateBadTanks flags becomes useful. If a tank was marked in the first pass
as unconfigured, it will be treated the same way as a new tank here. Tank and
index files are created (if necessary) and the tank starting point is set to
zero. 

This is where the danger lies: suppose you have a tank file with valuable
trace data. But both index files are corrupted for some reason. That will
cause the wave_server to fail to configure that tank on the first pass. If
ReCreateBadTanks is not set, that tank will get removed from the wave_server's
list, and the tank file will be untouched. Heroic efforts could be used to
regenerate its index files for later use. Now if ReCreateBadTanks is set, that
tank will have new index files created, and it will be overwritten as soon as
the wave_server starts running.

The wave_server has one more step to do in initialization. It has to go
through its list of tanks and remove any that were marked as BAD in the first
pass. There is a config flag, `PleaseContinue'. If this is not set, wave_server
will exit here is it finds any bad tanks. If PleaseContinue is set, then the
tank is simply removed from the internal list and forgotten. 

Once this third pass is done, wave_server writes its internal list to the
structure file and starts adding traces to their respective tanks. Each new
packet of trace data causes the current index entry for that tank to be
extended in time and file position. If there is a gap between the end of a
tank and the new trace data (determined by GapThresh in config file), a new
index entry is started. Wave_server periodically writes the index and
structure list to disk, to save the latest information in case of wave_server
crashes. 

The problem you had Monday afternoon has to do with a failure in the third
configuration pass. For some reason, the UPS tanks were not removed from the
tank list even though they had been marked as BAD. Then when wave_server got
running and tried to write an index file to disk, it found a NULL pointer for
the index of those tanks, and crashed. The index was NULL because it had not
been configured in the first or second passes. I found a core file from the
second crash and was able to glean this information from it and from the log
entries. I'm working with Dave Kragness to see if we can figure out why these
tanks weren't removed from the tank list.

Is that clean now? Yes, I know, all this needs to be added to the
documentation. 

Pete
