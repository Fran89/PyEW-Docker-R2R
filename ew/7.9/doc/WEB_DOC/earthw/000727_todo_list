Subject: todo list


Considerable modifications have been made to the todo list and some
real tasks are now in it.  Please feel free to tell me what you're
working on so I can add it in.  Short descriptions will be used
verbatim, long ones run the risk of errors in my interpretation
as I shorten them.  This will only work as well as the information
we put into it (GIGO).  And don't forget to volunteer for the
desired new functionality list.  I'm also in search of suggestions
to make the page more useful.
