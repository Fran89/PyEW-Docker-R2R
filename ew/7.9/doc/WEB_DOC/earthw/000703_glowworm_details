If anyone is interested, the following gives a brief description of the NT
modules for Earthworm that I have put together.  Though they are working
for me, I suspect that more wide-spread use would reveal some bugs or
shortcomings.  I have had problems with the install program, but hope that
the last run-through got that solved (the modules are NT-specific so they
involve getting all the right DLL's and OCX's installed and registered
properly).

One of the goals was to produce a system that completely replicated the
capabilities, including output in compatible data formats, of the old
PcSeis system, itself a variant of Willie Lee's IASPEI systems.  With the
final addition of the SSAM module, that has been achieved.

 Programs developed for GlowWorm

Programs that access transport rings

   AfmServer.exe    Establishes a TCPIP server for the client program
                    AfmController.exe to monitor incoming data and send
                    control messages to AFM field sites via a ring.  This
                    program is the forerunner to a proposed more
                    generalized InstrumentController.
   ComPortInterface.exe   Moves data between a serial port and a transport
                    ring.  It has special features to aid in use with
                    radios and data transmission.
   ComPortRepeater.exe    Sends data received from one ComPortInterface to
                    another ComPortInterface for retransmission.
   ContRecord.exe   Produces TrigList2k messages at set intervals.
                    Trig2Disk uses the messages to build successive data
                    files, thus producing a continuous record of seismic
                    trace data.
   DTRpulser.exe    Sends "pulse DTR" messages to ComportInterface at
                    specified intervals to provide a hardware watchdog
                    signal.
   FreewaveMonitor.exe    Determines if a communication link is still
                    active. Rainier AFM specific.
   LaharDetector.exe      Detects lahar signals by looking at real-time AFM
                    data.
   MessageCopier.exe      Copies specified messages from several rings into
                    a single ring.
   PagerInterface.exe     Relays TYPE_VHMEMO messages produced by other
                    modules to the 3rd party program PageMaster via a DDE.
                    (in development)
   RingPorky.exe    A Porky that looks at ring output from
                    ComportInterfaces to produce Bob data files of incoming
                    data.
   Rsam.exe         Records 1 and 10-minute RSAM values in Bob data files,
                    looks for RSAM events, and runs RSAM event and tremor
                    alarms.
   SCNxlator.exe    Replaces selected network fields produced by one
                    ComportInterface to that of another, thus making the
                    data look as though it had come from the second one.
                    Rainier AFM specific.
   SerialPortDecoder.exe  Decodes and parses data messages from
                    ComportInterface into a standard tabular data format.
   Ssam.exe         Records 1-minute SSAM values produced by ew2ssam.exe in
                    ascii data files. In one directory tree are the data
                    files compatible with the 16-band PcSeis output.  In
                    another tree are the full 128 fft-line data for all
                    future applications.
   vhMailMan.exe    Sends e-mail messages from TYPE_VHMEMO messages
                    produced by other modules.
   vhRingToSerial.exe     Transmits and receives selected messages from
                    selected rings from one system to another via either a
                    serial port (spread-spectrum radio) or a TCPIP port.
       vhStoretabledata.exe   Stores data in Tabular Messages into text,
Bob, or Access data files.
   vhWormManager.exe      Provides a central manager for the Earthworm
                    system.

Enhanced Earthworm modules

   CarlSubTrig.exe  Added the capability to use only a subset of a subnet's
                    stations to determine if the subnet has triggered, but
                    record all stations in the subnet.  Thus a noisy
                    station can be recorded in the subnet, but won't help
                    produce false subnet triggering.  Also added the
                    capability to designate the subnet by a 6-character
                    alpha name instead of just a number.
   Trig2Disk.exe    Uses the alpha subnet name in naming the data files or
                    directories for ease-of-sorting.
   Sgram.exe        Ported to run under NT as either standalone or in
                    conjunction with StartStop.
   Heli_standalone.exe    Ported to run under NT.


New message types

   TYPE_OBJECTSTATE Contains information for either setting an object state
                    (such as set instrument sample rate=x), the current
                    state of an object (such as radio link down, sample
                    rate =x, etc.), or the acknowledgement of a command
                    received.

   TYPE_MEMO        Contains messages to be sent as e-mail or to a pager.

   TYPE_VCOMPORT    Contains data received from or to be transmitted out of
                    a serial port, including serial port control lines.

   TYPE_VTABULARDATA      Contains one or more lines of tabular-type data.

Modules for remote control of field sites

   AfmController.exe      A client for AfmServer.exe, AfmController sends
                    control messages to Afm controllers and displays
                    incoming data.

Modules for remote display of incoming data

   LaharDisplay.exe Receives display information from the TCPIP server in
                    Lahar.exe.
   RemoteManager.exe      Receives current module status from the TCPIP
                    server in vhWormManager.exe.
   RsamDisplay.exe  Receives display information from the TCPIP server in
                    Rsam.exe.

Other modules

   Wait.exe         Provides a delay of a specified number of seconds
                    before continuing execution of a cmd or bat file, thus
                    allowing all drivers to load properly before attempting
                    to access them. The syntax for waiting 10 seconds would
                    be:   Wait.exe 10

   Archiver.exe     Copies data from the acquisition computer to an archive
                    area where it can copied onto archive media.  Syntax is
                    simply:    Archive.exe

   StartMe.exe      Provides the means to start a program from the command
                    line and assign it a priority of either idle, normal,
                    or high.  The syntax is:
                    Startme.exe "program" "arguments" "priority" "window
                    title"

Program development modules

                    and instrument control through a radio network.
   vhMessages.dll   Contains all selected Earthworm message objects.
   vhDataSocket.ocx Wraps Crescent tools CITCP.ocx into an easy-to-use
                    TCPIP socket ActiveX control.  Its login procedures
                    mate with vhTcpServer.ocx.  Setup menus and input file
                    i/o are encapsulated in the control.
   VhIpDataServer.ocx     Wraps Crescent tools CIServer.ocx into a
                    convenient TCPIP server ActiveX control.  Its login
                    procedures mate with the vhSocket.ocx client.  Setup
                    menus and input file i/o are encapsulated in the
                    control.
   vhTransportCtrl.ocx    Wraps the Earthworm transport routines in
                    TransportVb.dll into a moderately easy-to-use ActiveX

                    encapsulated in the control.
   vhxAdo.dll       Contains the wrappers to use ADO to store data in a
                    relational data base (in use, but still preliminary)
