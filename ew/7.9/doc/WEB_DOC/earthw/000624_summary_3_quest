Subject: Responses to my three questions

	Responses (11) to my three questions have been concatenated together
and put in the earthw-list archives for anyone interested in the details
(also includes those sent to me personnaly rather than to the list).

In a nut shell answers and solutions exist or are forthcoming.  They are:

1. Getting SOH from a Reftek DAS with 422 card ain't easy but can be
done.  Thanks to Jim Pechmann, Lynn Dietz and Dave Chavez.

2. Waveserver problems, things are being fixed to make it better.  Thanks to
Pete Lombard and Alex Bittenbinder.  BTW, those who suggested using the
"restart <pid>" method  had better look again.  The waveserver is the one
program that you better not use this on. Since it does not catch signals it
will quit, possibly in the middle of something leaving the tanks in a possible
bad state which may make things even worse.  It seems that this is being
fixed.

3. Several ways of doing mseed were suggested, anyone of which would probably
be fine, but the simplest might be a waveserver client already done... maybe
(?). It seems that no one at Lamont nor Paul Friberg on on the earthw-list and
so may not know there is an outstanding question.  You out there hanging from
some rock somewhere, Paul?  Thanks to Phil Maechling, Mike Stnickney and Alex.
