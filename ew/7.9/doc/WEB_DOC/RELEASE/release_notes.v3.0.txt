Earthworm Version 3.0 Release Notes
2/7/98

NEW MODULES:
***********

adsend:  The functionality of the Earthworm DOS a/d box has been implemented under Microsoft NT.  The NT Adsend  was designed to work with a single National Instruments DAQ board (model PCI-MIO-16E-4) and up to four MUX boards (model AMUX-64T).  The NT Adsend  is implemented as a standard Earthworm module within the Earthworm software architecture.  This allows additional Earthworm modules to be run on the same computer with Adsend.

getmenu: Separate program that requests the menu from a wave_server. 
   usage:  getmenu <server:port>  
   
restart: Separate program that send a TYPE_RESTART message to
startstop. usage:  restart <pid>.  This program is run by the statmgr
when a module no longer is sending a heartbeat.  To implement this
feature, the 'restartMe' parameter must be added to the module's .desc
file.

rcv_ew: The Earthworm suite now includes this program to permit turn-key, 
trace data exchange from the USNSN to the regional networks.

import_ida:  This program enables an Earthworm to retrieve and process continuous trace data from numerous IDA data servers.
   

MODIFICATIONS/BUG FIXES TO EXISTING MODULES:
*******************************************

hypo_mgr: The program creates two temporary arc files (later removed by
program).  The temp file names now have the module id appended to them.
This permits more than one instance of hypo_mgr to run.

binder: The heartbeat interval is now a configuration file parameter.  

eqprelim: The heartbeat interval is now a configuration file parameter.

pick_ew: MyModId is now a config file parameter.  This allows multiple
instances of pick_ew to run.

wave_serverIV: 
	* changed to select stations to be tanked by SCN name
		       rather than pin number.
	
	* changed to accept variable gap threshold

	* Added optional "Debug" parameter in .d file
	
	* Added one warning message if oversized trace message detected


copyfile() for Windows NT:  menlo_report was crashing after about 1200
rcp calls.  copyfile now closes the process and thread handles for rcp
and rsh.

arc2trig: As part of the change to the trigger message format: mod to cause
          it to write <S><C><N> names with space delimiters.

ringtocoax: An option was added to control packet broadcasting using
"wait timers".  ringtocoax blocks on a timer, which the kernel resets
every 0.01 second.  Each time the timer resets, ringtocoax sends a burst of
1 to 5 packets to the Ethernet line.  If the packets are not delayed in this
way, coaxtoring will drop packets.  Currently, the wait-timer option is only
supported under Windows NT.  

import_generic:
Changed as per Doug Neuhauser's suggestion for reading as much as available
from socket. It helped a lot. Thanks Doug.

export_generic:
Changed to accept Doug Neuhauser's bug fix for messages ending in an ESC.

startstop_solaris: now can be run in background as well as in foreground. This
is done by setting SIGTTIN to IGNORE. See the README file in 
src/startstop_solaris for details.

startstop_solaris:
Changed status message so that the arguments are included at the end of each
line, up to an 80-character wide line. When running multiple instances of a
module, this list of arguments will help identify the module instances.


CHANGES TO CONFIGURATION FILES:
*******************************
binder: HeartbeatInt added to the config file.

eqprelim: HeartbeatInd added to the config file.

pick_ew: MyModId added to the config file.

wave_serverIV:  * stations selected by SCN names rather than pin numbers.
 		* Switch to permit safe but slow operation: writes index file
 		  after every tank write.
		* threshold for declaring break in data.
		* Added optional "Debug" parameter in .d file


ringtocoax: Parameters added to control a Windows NT wait timer.

make_ew_os2.cmd: Modified for consistency with Solaris and Windows NT. 

ew_os2.cmd: Modified for consistency with Solaris and Windows NT. 

*.desc files:	Option 'restartMe' addded.
