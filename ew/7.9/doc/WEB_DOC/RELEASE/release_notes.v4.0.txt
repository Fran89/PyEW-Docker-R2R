Subject: Earthworm Version 4.0

Earthworm Version 4.0 has been released.  

You can download the release from our new ftp site:
	ghtftp.cr.usgs.gov:pub/OUTGOING/earthworm/release_v4.0

v4.0 is the official Y2K compliant release of Earthworm. It was verified
that all critical modules correctly function during the following
time intervals:

 o Dec 31, 1999 - Jan 1, 2000
 o Feb 28, 2000 - Feb 29, 2000
 o Feb 29, 2000 - Mar 1, 2000
 o Dec 31, 2000 - Jan 1, 2001


Critical modules are all those modules which enable Earthworm to 
 trigger on and locate an earthquake and save associated waveforms to 
disk.

Testing was performed under both Solaris and NT operating systems using
trace data for two Northern California earthquakes (provided in 
run_test/data directory). The date stamps of this trace data was shifted 
to correspond to each testing period. In addition, the system clock on 
the computer was also set to the time in the future being tested.


IMPORTANT CHANGE- AFFECTS ALL MODULES
*************************************
*************************************
All installation ids and global message types are now defined in
a file called earthworm_global.d  (earthworm_inst.d has been
expanded and renamed). The values defined in earthworm_global.d are 
critical to proper communication and data attribution among Earthworm 
systems around the globe.

A copy of earthworm_global.d must be placed in the EW_PARAMS directory 
(the official copy lives in the vX.X/environment directory).

   DO NOT make any changes to this file.  !!!!
The contents of this file are under the control of Earthworm Central.
Please direct any requested additions or changes to:

NEW MODULES
********************
waveman2disk: Not really a module, but a manual, interactive version
   of trig2disk. Its purpose is to manually request trace data from
   WaveServers and save it to disk in various supported formats. 
   It has two modes: triglist and interactive. In triglist mode, it
   reads a file containing one or more TYPE_TRIGLIST2K messages, then
   requests and writes out corresponding snippets of trace data. In 
   the interactive mode, it prompts the user for the start time and
   duration of snippets, then gets that data from the WaveServers and
   writes it out to disk. See the README in src/waveman2disk directory
   for more details. 

EARTHWORM DOCUMENTATION
******************************

The Earthworm web site has been upgraded to be consistent with
Version 4.0. 

CONTRIBUTED SOFTWARE
********************

Many Earthworm modules have been developed at regional networks to meet 
their specific needs.  Since some of these may be useful to other 
networks, we make these available at the Earthworm ftp site in the 
Contributed_software directory.  Currently, you will find modules 
developed at USGS Menlo Park, University of Memphis,  University of 
Washington and University of Alaska, Fairbanks.
