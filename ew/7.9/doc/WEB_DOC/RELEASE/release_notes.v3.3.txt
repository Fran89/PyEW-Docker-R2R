HIGHLIGHTS OF V3.3
*******************
A detailed description of Version 3.3 can be found in the release notes distributed with the tar or zip.

IMPORTANT CHANGES IN V3.3

New Name for 'Binder':
	The name for the associator program has been changed from
	'binder' to 'binder_ew'. The name 'binder' was an executable in
	the Solaris Openwindows software. If an user's path was not set
	up correctly, the Openwindows 'binder' would be run with hard
	to decipher error messages.  This modification will prevent
	this from happening to un-suspecting users in the future.

New Format for Wave_serverV Tank Structure:
	In Wave_serverV.  changed the format of the TANK
	structure, thus rendering previous TANK structure files
	useless.  If you are upgrading from v3.2, then this warning is
	for you.  There is a fix4_3.3 program, that converts tanks from
	version 3.X to 3.3 compliant tanks.  See the src/wave_serverV
	directory for details.

NEW MODULES:

heli1:
	heli1 is designed to rapidly provide GIF images of waveforms
	for helicorder style display on the WWW.  heli1 periodically
	retrieves current data for a selected list of stations and
	updates GIF images which are transferred to webserver(s).  The
	required waveforms are obtained via requests to Earthworm
	waveserver(s) and plotted directly to GIF format image files.
	When all of the required GIF files have been constructed, .html
	wrappers are built and the entire suite of files is copied via
	rcp to webserver(s) for viewing. Heli1 is a Solaris only
	module.  The NT version is in the works.

trig2disk:
	trig2disk reads type_triglist messages (e.g. those produced by
	arc2trig and  carltrig) and writes either sac or ah triggered
	data files to disk.  WARNING:  If you want to use the SAC
	conversion, you must specify the system architecture at compile
	time.  See the README in the source directory for details.
