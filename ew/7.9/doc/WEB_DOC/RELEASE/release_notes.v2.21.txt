Release Notes Earthworm Version 2.21

This version was the first official release of the Cleanup from v2.0.
The cleanup was inspired by comments from Kent Lindquist and help from
David Walter.

Changes Made:
*************

Created a libsrc directory with subdirectories for generally used functions and also for operating systems specific routines.

		util
		solaris
		os2

	Standarized the way configuration files are read and logging is
done.

	Created new directory structure with a run directory independent of
the versio directories.

	Handling of module id, ring ids,  etc. was made uniform and depends on
variables defined in earthworm.h.
