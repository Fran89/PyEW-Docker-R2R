RELEASE NOTES: EARTHWORM VERSION "V5.2"

NEW MODULES:
***********

file2ring: 
new diagnostic tool. This command-line program allows the user to
put the contents of a file into a specified Earthworm ring as a specified
Earthworm logo (installation, moduleid, message type). LDD 2/9/2001

gmew: 
ground-motion analyzer. Computes PGA, PGV, PGD and spectral response
for selected channels such as broadband and strongmotion instruments. 
Writes TYPE_STRONGMOTIONII messages, and optionally writes a ShakeMap XML 
file. PNL, 3/30/01

reboot_mss:  
This is a command line program to remotely reboot an MSS100.
Reboot_mss is spawned by program reboot_mss_ew.  There is no configuration
file.  The command-line syntax is:
reboot_mss <MSS100 IP address> <MSS100 password> [-q]
The reboot_mss program logs into the telnet port (port 23) of the 
MSS100.  Then, it issues a reboot command to the MSS100 and exits. 
If "-q" is specified, the program runs in "quiet mode", and it 
doesn't write anything to stdout.   WMK 4/23/01

reboot_mss_ew: 
This is an Earthworm module that monitors tracebuf
messages from any number of K2's.  If data stops being received from 
a K2 for a specified amount of time (eg 10 minutes), reboot_mss_ew 
assumes that the MSS100 is hung up, and it attempts to reboot the 
appropriate MSS100 by spawning reboot_mss as a child process. 
Rebooting seems to unhang MSS100s when they hang up.  If the ethernet 
link is down, reboot_mss_ew will periodically attempt to reboot the
MSS100.   WMK 4/23/01

heli_ewII:  Performs the same functions as heli_ew and heli_standalone in one program.
        1. Runs on NT and Solaris.
        2. Runs as a module: Specifying earthworm parameters in its
           configuration file will cause it to become a module. It will attach to
           the specified ring, produce heartbeats, and use earthworm logging. It can
           be restarted if it asserts 'restartMe' in its .desc file.
        3. Runs as a standalone program: If no Earthworm paramters are given in the
           .d file, it will run standalone. Errors will be written to stderr.
        4. Does not try to move files to another machine. This was removed in the name
           of security and modularity. Moving the image files to a separate server machine
           is a reasonable option, but should be done by another facility. Shared disks via
           operating system features or SendFile are two options.



MODIFICATIONS/BUG FIXES TO EXISTING MODULES:
*******************************************
libsrc/solaris/dirops_ew.c
libsrc/winnt/dirops_ew.c   
Added new function rename_ew() that allows one to rename files.  If a file 
already exists with the same name as the desired target, the old file is 
overwritten.  LDD 9/28/2000

Added new function RecursiveCreateDir() that will create a directory along 
withall of the parent directories that are required.  Written by Carol 
Bryan. 04/05/2001
  
sendmail.c
A bug fix to libsrc/solaris/sendmail.c: it was doing a free() on a 
declared array. This seemingly fixed a problem with statmgr. Problem was 
that statmgr on Solaris would exit if the mail address didn't have enough 
periods in it. (!) Alex 3/16/1

Mem_circ_queue
Replaced queue_max_size.o with mem_circ_queue.o in the following 
makefiles:
  data_exchange/vdl/SCRIPTS/makefile.sol_ew
  display/sgram/makefile.sol
  seismic_processing/eqbuf/makefile.sol
  seismic_processing/eqbuf/makefile.nt
DavidK 2001/04/12

gaplist:
Program now ignores the InBufl parameter.  The trace buffer length is set 
to MAX_TRACEBUF_SIZ from the file trace_buf.h.  gaplist also ignores the 
MaxScn parameter.  Any number of Scn lines are permitted.  The gap bins 
are also changed. WMK 4/19/01

wave_serverV
Fixed a bug in serve_trace.c: if a tank file was closed by the
main thread while a server thread was accessing it, the next I/O error 
that the server thread saw would send it to the "abort" section of 
_writeTraceDataAscii or _writeTraceDataRaw. Here a call to fseek() would
fail and lead to an endless loop of failed fseek calls. The fseek calls
weren't necessary, so I removed them. PNL 10/4/2000

Added error responses to wave_serverV routines that reply to client
requests.  Wave_serverV now issues an error response to the client when
an error occurs while handling the client's request.  There are two
types of error replies, general ones that start with "ERROR ", and
specific replies where the error is described by one of three new
flags: FN, FB, or FC.  See comments at top of  wave_serverV.c for 
more info. DK 01/08/2001

Added code to issue status messages when hard errors occur on tanks
(previously a log message was issued on reads, and the program exited
on errors from write.) Davidk 01/19/2001

Added ability to continue to operate after failure of a single tank
(previously wave_serverV executed on a tank write error.)  Continuance
is controlled by a new config file param: #AbortOnSingleTankFailure.
See README.changes in wave_serverV source directory for more info.
Davidk 01/19/2001

wave_viewer:  
Modified to handle new wave_serverV error response 

flags. The only noticable change to the end user should be when 

the user chooses to view a group of traces (Group tab from Menu 
Bar), and one or more of the channels in the group is unavailable.  
In previous releases, wave_viewer would just hang, now wave_viewer 
will recognize the channel as being unavailable from the 
wave_server but will continue to retrieve data for other 
channels from the server.  New version is 1.23 DK 01/08/2001

k2ew: 
The program now calculates how long it's been since the GPS

receiver locked to the satellites.  If greater than GPSLockAlarm

hours, k2ew logs a warning and sends a message to statmgr.
If the GPS synchs up later, k2ew will send another message to
statmgr. WMK 11/7/00

When the DontQuit parameter is set, the program now doesn't quit
if it can't connect to the MSS100.  Instead, it retries the connection
forever.  I also made cosmetic changes to the k2ew log file format.
WMK 11/29/00

gaplist: 
The program accepts a new, optional configuration parameter,

ReportDeadChan.  If a channel is dead for more than ReportDeadChan

minutes, gaplist will send a message to statmgr.  In the gap table,
if there is one star in the "Dead" column, it means the channel has
been dead less than ReportDeadChan minutes.  If there are two stars
in the "Dead" column, it means that the channel has been dead for more
than ReportDeadChan minutes, and that an error message has been sent
to statmgr.  WMK 11/20/00

eqfilter: 
Removed several unnecessary objects and system libraries

from the link line of both makefiles. Since eqfilter doesn't talk to

wave_servers, there is no need to link in the ws_clientII routines
or the earthworm or system socket stuff. PNL 11/30/00
          Fixed bug that caused eqfilter to ignoring event messages 
if tport_getmsg returned GET_MISS or GET_NOTRACK.  LDD 4/26/2001

libsrc/winnt/time_ew.c: 
timegm_ew did not work correctly unless the system
timezone was set to GMT; this is becuase _tzset() was not called before
the call to mktime(). It turns out that the changes that timegm_ew was
making to the TZ environment variable were completely unnecessary. The
result is that timegm_ew is now much simpler. PNL 11/30/00

carlstatrig: 
changed ProcessTraceMsg() in protrace.c to log an error and

return 0 immediately if WaveMsgMakeLocal fails.  Previously, it returned

an error code which would cause carlstatrig to exit. Now carlstatrig will
just skip the offending tracebuf msg and continue.  LDD 01/17/2001

Fixed bugs in CopyToNew() and UpdateStation(). These bugs would

occasionally cause NaN values to be inserted into a station LTA on 
startup,preventing that station from generating any triggers. PNL 
1/29/2001

sniffring: 
Added printing of ascii messages.  LDD 01/22/2001

Added fflush(stdout) so that a file actually gets written when one

redirects stdout with >fileame.  LDD 02/13/2001



libsrc/solaris/time_ew.c
libsrc/winnt/time_ew.c: 
Fixed a roundoff bug in datestr23 and datestr23_local.

These functions convert time as a double to a character string rounded to 

the nearest hundredth of a second. The bug caused times with fractional 

seconds >= 0.995 to be printed incorrectly (example: 30.99843 was being
was being converted to 30.100 instead of 31.00). LDD 1/23/2001

makefile.sol for many modules:
Removed compilation flags -D_SPARC and -D_SOLARIS from CFLAGS= lines.  
These flags should be set in a user's earthworm environment setup file,
ew_sol_sparc.cmd or ew_sol_intel.cmd.  The existence of these flags in the
makefile was causing trouble for anyone who wanted to compile for an
Intel Solaris platform. In carlstatrig, these flags caused 4-byte integer
trace data to be misinterpreted as float data, resulting in NaN for most
triggering variables. Makefile.sol was changed for the following modules:
 carlstatrig 
 eqfilter
 import_generic 
 q2ew
 sac2hypo
 sm_file2ring 
 sm_reftek2ew
 template 
 trig2disk 
 waveman2disk
LDD 1/31/2001

libsrc/util/tankputaway.c: 
removed a bunch of code that made a failed attempt

to multiplex TRACEBUF messages. Now tankputaway.c writes all packets to

disk in the order they are received. Use "remux_tbuf", a contributed
program from Menlo PArk, to multiplex the output of tankputaway.c to
make a file that can be read by tankplayer. PNL, 3/27/01

naqs2ew: 
added functionality to convert Nanometrics compressed data packets

into Earthworm tracebuf messages (previously only worked with
Nanometrics uncompressed data packets). Earthworm messages created from
compressed NMX packets will be of varying length, with the maximum number
of samples per packet configurable. Earthworm messages created from
NMX uncompressed packets are generally 1 second long. LDD 4/3/2001

arc2trig: 
fixed bug that made it crash on terminate: the trig file was 

being closed unconditionally, but it wasn't always opened. PNL 4/7/01



libsrc/winnt/makefile.nt and libsrc/util/makefile.nt: 
revised to make them work like real makefiles. Dpendencies are now checked 
so that compilation proceeds only if it is really needed.  PNL 4/11/01



localmag: 
renamed site.c and site.h to lm_site.c/lm_site.h, to avoid 

confusion with similar files in libsrc/utils.  PNL 4/11/01

carlsubtrig: 


putaway: 
deleted two obsolete variables formerly used only by sudsputaway 

from the PA_next_ev argument list; replaced them with a new variable used 
to carry subnet names to sudsputaway CJB 3/21/01

sudsputaway: 
Added option to use subnet names in the filename; also, limit 

eventid to 3 characters. CJB 3/21/01



trig2disk and waveman2disk: 
major overhaul to fix bugs, improve efficiency.

Moved the xdr* and related files (used only by NT for ahputaway) to
libsrc/winnt/rpc. Reorganized the putaway include files so that
format specific header information is in sachead.h, while putaway-specific
items are in *putaway.h All the function prototypes used to access the
format-specific putaway routines is in pa_subs.h. Created putaway.h, that
lists the function prototypes for the main putaway routines. Reformated
the code so most of it isn't tabbed acorss the page; revised many 
comments.
See src/archiving/waveman2disk/Changes for more details. See also the
changes to each of the config files, listed below. PNL 4/12/01

hyp2000_mgr: 
Added the 200, COP, and CAR commands to the hyp2000 startup

section.  This forces hyp2000 to use the formats produced and expected

by other Earthworm modules. It eliminates the need for these commands
to be listed in the user's standard hypoinverse startup file.
LDD 4/18/01 

reboot_mss: 
The program now uses the MSS100 remote console port (7000),

instead of the telnet port (23).  Univ of Washington can't use port 23
at K2 sites behind firewalls.  WMK 4/26/01

Added the -l option, which logs out the MSS100 serial port
rather than rebooting the MSS100.  Logging out the serial port is faster
than rebooting.  WMK 4/26/01

reboot_mss_ew: Added new configuration file parameter (Logout).  If Logout
is set to 1, reboot_mss_ew will log out the MSS100 serial port rather than
rebooting the MSS100.  Logging out the serial port is faster than rebooting.
WMK 4/26/01

CARLSUBTRIG: Changes made to support new features:

earthworm.h:
new definition: MAX_SUBNET_LEN - defines the length of the name of 
subnets optionally read in carlsubtrig. The value of MAX_SUBNET_LEN is 
currently set to 10 (i.e., a subnet name of 9 characters terminated 
with a null character).

parse_trig.h:
The Snippet structure has been expanded to include a 
subnet[MAX_SUBNET_LEN] variable. The variable subnet[i] contains the name 
of the ith subnet defined in carlsubtrig.

Parse_trig.c:
Modified to look for and read the optional subnet variable.

carlsubtrig.c:
1) subnets:
a) Non-numeric subnet names (currently <= 9 characters in length) read 
in carlsubtrig are now stored and passed through to later routines through 
the triglist2k message. Subnet names are optional. If the subnet name 
read from carlsubtrig.d is numeric, no subnet is passed through to later 
routines. Currently the subnets are used only in filenames written in 
sudsputaway. 
b)  If several subnets trigger simultaneously, but still less than the 
Allsubnets parameter, the subnet code of the last triggered subnet in the 
list in the input file will be used for the Subnet.  Therefore, if you 
have nested subnets (say a dome subnet and a volcano subnet), the larger 
subnet should be listed after the smaller in the input file.
c)  If the number of subnets triggered is sufficient to meet or exceed 
the Allsubnets parameter, the Subnet field of the triglist2k message 
will default to "Regional".

2) A "|" symbol can be used in the list of stations to differentiate those 
stations to be used in the trigger count (stations to the left of "|") 
and those stations that are not.  All stations in a subnet are recorded 
if sufficient stations to the left of the "|" are triggered. 
If no "|" symbol is present, behavior defaults to that of previous 
versions of the program.

putaway.c:
PA_next_ev carried two arguments that were used only by sudsputaway. 
With the new subnet variable, these two variables are now obsolete, 
and have been deleted. The subnet variable, however,  was added to the 
argument list of PA_next_ev. The prototype of PA_next_ev is now: 
int     PA_next_ev (char *EventID, TRACE_REQ *trace_req, int num_req, 
int FormatInd, char *OutDir, char *EventDate,   char *EventTime, 
char *EventSubnet, int debug);

sudsputaway.c:
1) Subnet names (if alphanumeric) are used in the suds filenames. 
If no subnet is named, the installation name is used in the filename. 
Thus, suds filenames are of the form: yyyymmdd_hhmmss_subnet_evid.dmx.

2)  The EventId field of the filename is set to 3 characters.  
If the EventId is greater than 999, it is truncated to the last 3 digits. 
Leading zeroes are added to numbers less than 100.


CHANGES TO CONFIGURATION FILES and DESCRIPTOR FILES:
**************************************************** 
k2ew: 
The configuration file now has the capability to rename the
station coming off the k2. This is an override mechanism and allows
the name to be specified in the .d file for legacy station names. In
this instance, the owner of the K2 wanted to keep the name as a number
and the institution pulling data (CalTech) processed the data using
a station NAME. The new parameter is StationID followed by the new
station name. The location on the k2 where this comes from is the stnid
parameter. This was tested only under Solaris using serial communications
and works for both restart and non-restart modes.
PAF 4/23/2001 p.friberg@isti.com

Configuration files contain a new optional parameter, GPSLockAlarm.
If the GPS hasn't locked for GPSLockAlarm hours, a warning message will
be logged and an error will be sent to statmgr.  The k2ew descriptor file
now contains a new error for loss of GPS synch to the satellites.  WMK 
11/7/00

gaplist: 
Configuration file contains new optional parameter: ReportDeadChan.
If the config file doesn't contain ReportDeadChan, 10.0 minutes is the
default value.  WMK 11/20/00

wave_serverV.d:
A new command was added: AbortOnSingleTankFailure
The default behavior is the same as before, but setting
AbortOnSingleTankFailure to 0 will cause wave_serverV
to continue even if there is a hard error on a tank.  DK 1/19/2001

wave_serverV.desc:
two new error messages were added to the descriptor file.
Error 7 is issued when a hard i/o error occurs on a
tank or index file (this does not include a failed open).
Error 8 is issued when a server thread cannot write a
tank summary to the client (unless it failed because there
was no data in the tank).  DK 1/19/2001
#
err: 7  nerr: 1  tsec: 0  page: 0 mail: 99
text: "hard i/o error on tank or index file"
#
err: 8  nerr: 1  tsec: 0  page: 0 mail: 99
text: "failed to write summary for a tank"

waveman2disk.d: 
Removed TravelTimeout and MaxTraceMsg since
they served no useful purpose.  PNL 4/12/01

trig2disk.d: 
Removed TravelTimeout since it served no useful purpose.
Added optional QueueSize, QueueFile for saving trigger queue to disk
and reloading on restart.
Added optional DelayTime to delay processing of trigger message, allowing
for traces to arrive at the wave_server.
Removed pin number from the TriggerStation command, since it wasn't used.
  PNL 4/12/01

trig2disk.desc: 
added the missing error messages and their config 
parameters.  PNL 4/12/01

gaplist.d:
Program now ignores the InBufl parameter.  The trace buffer length is set 
to MAX_TRACEBUF_SIZ from the file trace_buf.h.  gaplist also ignores the 
MaxScn parameter.  Any number of Scn lines are permitted. WMK 4/19/01

carlsubtrig.d:
A "|" symbol can be used in the list of stations to differentiate those 
stations to be used in the trigger count (stations to the left of "|") and 
those stations that are not.  All stations in a subnet are recorded if 
sufficient stations to the left of the "|" are triggered. If no "|" symbol 
is present, behavior defaults to that of previous versions of the program.


KNOWN BUGS or DEFICIENCIES:
**************************
In Windows NT, the time resolution of sleep_ew() is about 16 msec (one clock
tick).  On Solaris, the resolution is about 10 msec.  This is a problem for 
ringtocoax, since packet delays need to be set to a few milliseconds.

Automatic restarts of adsend (using the "restartMe" line in the descriptor
file) can cause an NT system to hang. Therefore, you should never
use the autorestart feature with adsend, but you should bring down
the entire Earthworm system if adsend needs to be restarted.
LDD 5/31/2000 Comments added to adsend.desc, but leave this warning here!

statmgr: A space is needed between "tsec:" and the value. 
If it isn't there, things fail. (Alex)

threads functions: The KillThread function on WindowsNT and Solaris
terminate the thread without ensuring that no mutexes are held. If a thread
holds a mutex when it dies, no other thread can get that mutex. PNL 1/12/2000

carlsubtrig:  The system time must be set to GMT and ew_nt.cmd must have 
TZ=GMT for carlsubtrig to work.  Comments in ew_nt.cmd done 5/25/00. Barbara
	
ew2seisvole: on NT, exits with horrible crash when system is stopped.

Wave_viewer will display fictitious 2 to 3 sample gaps when scrolling the 
display.
 This does not happen all of the time and is only visible when there are less 
than
 200 samples on the display (2 seconds of data for 100hz data.) DK 2000/06/01

libsrc/util/putaway.c: there is no include file for the putaway routines,
  thus any errors in arguments passed to putaway routines are not checked
  by the compiler.   PNL 7/10/2000

NUMBER OF RINGS LIMITED ON SOLARIS:
Under Solaris 2.6 (and probably other versions as well), the maximum number 
of shared memory segments is six. This means that on an out-of-the-box machine
you can only configure six rings. If you try to configure more than that, you
will see a cryptic message from tport_create about too many open files.  The
fix to this problem is to add the following lines to the /etc/system
file, and then reboot the system.

 set shmsys:shminfo_shmmax = 4294967295
 set shmsys:shminfo_shmmin = 1
 set shmsys:shminfo_shmmni = 100
 set shmsys:shminfo_shmseg = 20
 set semsys:seminfo_semmns = 200
 set semsys:seminfo_semmni = 70

This allows for 20 rings.

     Lucky Vidmar (7/6/2000)


startstop_solaris: There MAY be a problem with the signal that 
startstop sends to modules during the shutdown sequence. The shutdown 
sequence is started (after typing "quit" to startstop or running "pau")
by startstop placing a terminate message on all transport rings. Modules
should see this message and start their own shutdown. After a configurable
delay, startstop checks to see that all modules have exitted. Any that are 
still running are sent a signal to terminate them. Currently that signal
is SIG_TERM. But since wave_serverV has a handler for SIG_TERM, wave_serverV
sees that as essentially the same as a terminate message. So if wave_serverV
is having problems completing its shutdown, SIG_TERM won't do anything. The
result is that startstop may give up and exit, leaving wave_serverV running.
If that happens, the operator will have to terminate wave_serverV by doing
"kill -9 <wave_serverV-pid>". That may leave shared memory and semaphores
stranded in the kernel: run the command "ipcs -a" to see. If necessary,
the stranded shared memory and semaphores may be cleaned up with the
ipcrc command; must be run as root; see the man page.
This problem only exists on Solaris/Unix, not on WindowsNT.
PNL, 10/4/2000

libsrc/utils/kom.c: The comment above k_open() says that only one file can
be open at a time. Yet the Kbuf array has slots for MAXBUF (currently 4) open
files. Does this work, or is the comment to be taken at it's word?
PNL 10/15/00

libsrc/utils/site.c: The strings used for station, channel and network are
required to be fixed length with trailing spaces added to short names. If
the strings given to site_index do not have these trailing blanks, SCN names
will not match. This is not documented anywhere.  PNL 10/15/00

libsrc/utils/logit.c: logit_init() requires a module_id number, which it uses
to construct the log file name. This is not helpful, since the module_id
number is not meaningful to people. Worse, it requires that the config file be
read and earthworm.d lookups be completed before logit calls can be made. Thus
errors in the config file can only be reported to stderr or stdout instead of
being saved in a file.  PNL 11/29/00

trig2disk and waveman2disk: these two programs have a TravelTimeout option in 
their config files. This feature does not work, since the "wait time" feature 
has never been implemented in wave_serverV.  PNL 11/29/00
FIXED PNL, 4/11/01

TRACEBUF messages.
The definition of `endtime' of the TRACEBUF message is not documented.
Some programmers are taking it as the "expected start time of the next
TRACEBUF packet (if the sample interval is uniform.)" The more accepted
practice is that `endtime' is the time of the last sample of the current
TRACEBUF packet; that is, one sample interval less than the expected
start time of the next TRACEBUF messsage. Using this last definition, if a
TRACEBUF packet has exactly one sample, then its starttime and endtime are
the identical. Clearly this distinction needs to be documented. The file
waveform_format (in the /home/earthworm/DOC directory) gives no specifics 
about start or end times.  PNL 1/24/01
