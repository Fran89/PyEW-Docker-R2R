Release Notes:  Earthworm Version 2.31

New Modules:
************

EQVERIFY: One of the sausage routines. 
	The Program  takes an event message from eqcoda and studies the:
	+ distribution of arrival times and                            
	+ coda amplitude characteristics and coda duration            
	and make a decision about whether the event is a noise-event    
	or a real earthquake                                            
	
	NOTE: This code was written to emulate the glitch-detecting part
	 of the program "eqmeas" by Al Lindh and Barry Hirshorn.  Some  
 	variables used here store the same information about the pick  
 	or coda that eqmeas does.  In that case, the equivalent eqmeas 
	 variable name is included in the comments of the variable       
 	declaration as ("name").


Modifications to existing modules:
**********************************

HYPO_MGR: OS/2 Version.  
	Modified to reset the maximum number of file handles.  Done because
	we could not run eqverify in the sausage due to running out of file
	handles.  Solaris did not have this problem.


Modules in Progress:

	Export - version that forks under Solaris.
