NOTE: Hypoinverse source code is not the same on the Solaris and OS2
	releases.  We hope to fix this in the future by having Fred
	Klein come up with an ansi version of hypoinverse.  In order to
	compile hypoinverse with the OS2 Fortran compiler, we made many
	changes to the hypoinverse code.

WARNINGS:

Version 2.22 is only a OS2 version.  OS2 Version 2.22 was run through QA suite and passed with high marks from David Oppenheimer.
Solaris version was not created.

When attempting to move the official v2.22 release from natash to newt, the following problems were found:

	1. EQPROC - on natasha, the eqproc directory contains the file
		log_everything.c  This is not in the v2.22 eqproc directory
		on newt.

	2. EXPORT - export directories are different.

	3. LIBSRC/SOLARIS - is not complete on natasha.

	4. MENLO_REPORT - has file 'makesolaris' on newt; not on natasha

	5. PICKER - on solaris, still has 'makefile' in directory

	6. STARTSTOP_SOLARIS - version on natasha is not most recent.
