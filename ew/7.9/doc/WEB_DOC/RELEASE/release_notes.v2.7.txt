RELEASE NOTES EARTHWORM VERSION 2.7
1/24/96


OPERATING SYSTEMS:
******************

Most of Version 2.7 runs on OS2 Warp 3.0 and Solaris, both on intel and SparcStations.  Exception to this are:
	vdl:		Runs only under Solaris, either on Sparc or Intel.
	lptrg:		Runs only under OS2
	trg_assoc:	Runs only under OS2
	getdst:		Runs only under OS2


FORMAT CHANGES:
***************

A new waveform data message has been created.  It stores data from only one channel per message.  For details, see waveform.format in the DOC directory.


NEW MODULES:
************

vdl:	

VDL is the USNSN Virtual Data Logger, which is a software version of a
Quanterra data logger. vdl has been turned into an Earthworm module.
The vdl module retrieves the waveform data from channels specified by
the user in the configuration file. The vdl module passes the waveform
channels to the USNSN VDL code which  executes a trigger, and sends
home (to the USNSN) compressed event data  (in USNSN format).


getdst:

OS2 based software used for collecting DST ( Digital telemetry system
developed by Gray Jensen at USGS, Menlo Park ) data. The GETDST
computer is connected to a DIGI D/DON16 16 port serial input device.
Each port is used to receive three components from one DST station.
Data is time-stamped at the central site using a TrueTime PC-SG clock
catd.  Data telemetry is one way.  Data lost cannot be recovered.
getdst detects dropouts using sync-bytes and preserves available data
samples. getdst outputs data in the earthworm universal waveform format.


lptrig:

Runs John Evans' long-period trigger algorithm.  lptrig takes as input
a file of channel names with a flag set for those on which the trigger
algorithm should be run and a configuration file where the user can
specify trigger parameters.  Outputs a long_period trigger message for
each triggered channel.

lp_assoc:

Gets the long_period trigger messages and determine if there has been a long-period event.  The association parameters are set in the trg_assoc configuration file, trg_assoc.d.

cubic_msg:

This module converts the hypo71 summary message to a message in cubic
format.  Currently, these messages are being exported to Alan Jones'
program SEISMIC for display.

ad_demux:

Ad_demux demultiplexes the A/D mulitplexed waveform message into the single channel waveform message.

 

MODIFICATIONS/BUG FIXES TO EXISTING MODULES:
********************************************


Import_generic:

Hypoinverse:  

There is now only one hypoinverse.  Prior to this release, there was
separate hypoinverse for OS2 and solaris.  There have been a few
command changes which are not documented at this point.



CHANGES TO CONFIGURATION and DESCRIPTOR FILES:
**********************************************

Earthworm.d

This file contains the Earthworm adminstrative setup rather than
hard-coded as was previously done.  The system will not run without
this file. The file defines all installtion-specific information on
shared memory rings, module ids and message types.

New configutation file:

	vdl_ew.d

	vdl_ew.desc

	getdst.d

	getdst.desc

	lptrig_a.d

	lptrig_a.desc

	trg_assoc.d

	trg_assoc.desc


KNOWN BUGS or DEFICIENCIES:
**************************

Will has moved us from os/2 v2 to os/2 v3. v2 is no longer available,
and v3 offers better stability; v2 seems to have some GUI bugs. Never
mind that NT may come: we play the ball where it lies.  Will had
to create new makefiles, as yes, they're different from OS2 v2. The files in
earthworm/working/bin, named to_os2v2.cmd and to_os2v3.cmd copy the
corresponding versions of the makefiles into the standard name
"makefile.os2" found in each module's source directory.

Ad_demux:

Does not put error messages on the ring, so statmgr will know nothing about ad_demux error messages.  Statmgr will report if the ad_demux's heart stops beating.


MODULES IN PROGRESS:
********************

A picker module based on the Rex Allen algorithm.  It's new features are:
	* process the new waveform format for single channel data
	* allow each channel to have it own picking parameters.

A new wave_server which will store data and service requests on a per
channel basis.  Uses the new waveform format.
