<H3>Network Characteristics:</H3>
Pacific Northwest National Laboratory helps maintain the eastern Washington
portion of the Pacific Northwest Seismograph Network, a set of about 30
analog short-period stations with radio and microwave telemetry.  These
stations along with several local stations in the Pasco Basin are recorded
at PNNL as part of its environmental monitoring of the Hanford region.

<H3><CENTER>Standard EarthWorm Modules in current Use:</CENTER></H3>

PNL is installing an earthworm system
on a Pentium 200 MHz MME processor running Windows NT. 
The system includes two external fast-wide scsi disks
in addition to the standard EIDE internal drive
(2x4 Gb Seagate Barracuda, on Adaptec 2940 controller),
3Com 3C905 10/100 Mb/s network interface,
National Instruments PCIMIO16E4 12-bit A/D converter with AMUX64T multiplexer.
We immediately plan to use the PC and earthworm software
to monitor approximately 40 analog-telemetry stations from the eastern
Washington region.
Future integration of additional broad-band and strong motion instruments is
expected, as are automatic notification functions.
Analysis, reporting, and data archival will be conducted by analysts using UNIX
workstations and UW analsis software.
