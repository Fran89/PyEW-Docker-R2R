OVERVIEW
</H2>
<P>
The Earthworm/EarlyBird system acquires, processes, and analyzes both digital 
and analog seismic data in real-time from seismometers located worldwide.  The USGS 
Earthworm software acts as a data interface for the WC&ATWC.  All data imported from other 
networks or exported to other centers is received/SENT via Earthworm modules.  A module
written by the USGS for the WC&ATWC passes data to the NT based EarlyBird processing
system in a local format.  The EarlyBird system was developed at the WC&ATWC for locating
and sizing earthquakes as rapidly as possible and issuing tsunami notifications to the 
appropriate emergency personnel.  This software automatically locates and sizes
local, regional, and teleseismic earthquakes upon P-wave arrivals.
<P>
The Earthworm initiative at the WC&ATWC began as a result of NOAA's <A href=
"http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/tsunami-hazard"> National Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Program</A>.
One aspect of this program is to enhance the tsunami warning centers with
seismic data from networks operated by regional earthquake centers.  The USGS is 
implementing this task and has chosen Earthworm as the standard for seismic data and
hypocenter parameters exchange.
<P>
A system of dedicated circuits was installed to connect the WC&ATWC and the Pacific 
Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC) with the National Earthquake Information Center,
the USGS at Meno Park, the University of Washington, the Alaska Earthquake Information
Center, and the Hawaii Volcanoes Observatory.  Connections can be made with other
organizations also (such as the Alaska Volcano Observatory and the Pacific Geoscience
Center, Canada).  These other connections are made through public internet.  The <A href=
"atwc.gif"> Earthworm/EarlyBird configuration</A> is set up so that two processing 
systems are running concurrently in case of a system or network malfunction.  The
primary system, Worm1, acquires data from the regional centers through the dedicated
circuits along with data from other sources through the internet.  It also exports data
as needed via the dedicated circuits.  The secondary system,
Worm2, acquires all data through the internet.  Each of these SOLARIS systems has a direct
TCP/IP connection with a Windows NT PC (EarlyBird 1 and 2).  The Earthworm software also
runs on these systems to acquire the data from Worm1 and 2 and to operate an
analog-to-digital card for acquiring the WC&ATWC Alaska seismic network.  An Earthworm
module, ew_atwc, reformats the data and passes it to the EarlyBird
processes.  EarlyBird sees all data in a consistent format and performs all seismic
analysis.  EarlyBird 1 and 2 are also on a local Windows NT LAN.  This LAN accomodates
data transfer between the various PCs in use operationally at the WC&ATWC and enhances
tsunami message dissemination.
<P>
At present, the systems process approximately 90 channels of seismic data.  The 
data comes from the following sources: WC&ATWC Alaska network, USGS National Earthquake 
Information Center, USGS Menlo Park, UC Berkeley, University of Washington, 
IRIS/IDA Near Real Time System, IRIS/Albuquerque Seismic Lab, 
Alaska Earthquake Information Center, and the Southern California 
Seismic Network.  Aproximately half the channels are analog and half are
digital broadband.
<P>
In addition to exchanging seismic data with other centers, the Earthworm modules in Worm1
and Worm2 accomodate transfer of near real-time hypocenter information computed at other
centers.  As locations and magnitudes are computed for local earthquakes at the USGS
Menlo Park and the University of Washington, these are printed out at the WC&ATWC and are 
displayed on a map.  The WC&ATWC program <A href="earthvu.gif"> EarthVu</A> displays 
the locations of all earthquakes located by the other centers over the last week.

<LI>
<STRONG>import_generic</STRONG> - Receive Earthworm TRACE_BUF and H71SUM messages from 
other centers.  Each center's connection requires a separate import_generic.
</LI>
<LI>
<STRONG>export_scn</STRONG> - Transmit Earthworm TRACE_BUF messages to other 
centers when just certain channels are to be transmitted from a ring.  Each center's 
connection requires a separate export_scn.

convert this to TRACE_BUF format.
