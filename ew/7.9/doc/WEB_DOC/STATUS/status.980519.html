<H3>RECENT DEVELOPMENTS:</H3> <UL> <LI><B>RefTek Interface:</B>  
RefTek has issued the following announcement:
<P>
May 13, 1998
<P>
New <TT>EARTHWORM</TT> Development Partner...
<P>
Refraction Technology, Inc. (REF TEK) of Dallas, TX has signed on as the 
latest <TT>EARTHWORM</TT> development partner.  REF TEK intends to develop interface 
software that will allow REF TEK products to source data to <TT>EARTHWORM</TT> via 
industry standard protocols and interfaces.
<P>
Specifically, REF TEK has contracted with David Chavez of Engineering 
Services & Software to write a REF TEK data source module for <TT>EARTHWORM</TT> 
that will link the REF TEK Protocol (RTP).  RTP is designed to provide an 
error-free, ordered transport over UDP/IP/PPP data links.  This enables a 
computer running <TT>EARTHWORM</TT> to communicate with a REF TEK DAS via 
asynchronous serial ports on the local computer or via Ethernet through 
asynchronous serial ports on a Cisco 25xx router.  This data source module 
will integrate any Ref Tek 72 series DAS equipped with an RT422 Error 
Correcting Communications (ECC) Card with the <TT>EARTHWORM</TT> system.  The RT422 
ECC Card communicates with the central computer using RTP encapsulated 
within UDP/IP/PPP over a asynchronous serial interface.
<P>
The initial project is expected to be complete by the end of June, 1998 
with the delivery of 20 systems to India.  Following the initial project, 
REF TEK intends to port the DAS serial code to other products including its 
112 Modem Interface.  This will allow network operators who are currently 
using REF TEK Radio Modem telemetry to source data to <TT>EARTHWORM</TT>.
<P>

<P> <LI><B>Module release scheme:</B>  New modules are coming
off the assembly lines too fast for our existing release mechanism. Producing
a new version of <TT>EARTHWORM</TT> for each module would require a lot of installing, 
which is painfull at best. After some discussions, we've done the following:

<P>On the public FTP site on <I>ghtftp</I>, there is now the directory.
<A HREF="ftp://ghtftp.cr.usgs.gov/pub/OUTGOING/earthworm">
ftp://ghtftp.cr.usgs.gov/pub/OUTGOING/earthworm</A>.
This will contain the source and makefiles
for modules which are not included in the last release,
but which have been tested and are available for use. 

<P> <LI><B>EvansTrig: </B>
The venerable long-period trigger algorithm has been ported into a contemporary
<TT>EARTHWORM</TT> module. The previous version, consisting of 'lptrig' and 'trigassoc' predated
the current trace data format.

<P> <LI><B>Compress_UA: </B>
The BRTT compression algorithm has been incorporated into the modules 'compress_UA' and
'decompress_UA'. The modules seem to have done well in tests between Menlo Park and Fairbanks.

<P> <LI><B>CarlTrig: </B>
The code originally written by Brian Moon of PNL has been
modified and debugged by Pete Lombard of UofW and is currently under extensive
tests at the UofW. It is being run in parellel with the UW <TT>SUNWORM</TT>
trigger which uses the orginal Carl Johnson STA/LTA-subnet trigger algorithm
tuned to be very sensitive to even very small earthquakes.
The tests are indicating that the new <TT>EARTHWORM</TT> version of CarlTrig
performs as well or better than the original.
As soon as the documentation and a distribution version of the code is
complete it will be available for general use. (within a week or so).
