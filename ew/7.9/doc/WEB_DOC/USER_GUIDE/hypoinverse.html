HYPOINVERSE2000 determines earthquake locations and magnitudes 
from seismic network data like first-arrival P and S arrival 
times, amplitudes and coda durations. The last version 
HYPOINVERSE2000 (version 1.2) is in routine use by the Hawaiian Volcano 
Observatory, The Northern California Seismic Network, the 
Nevada network, and many other networks. It is the standard 
location program supplied with the Earthworm seismic acquisition 
and processing system and has thus gotten wide use. Crustal 
models can be multiple to cover different regions, and either 
flat layer or flat layer with linear velocity gradients. Version 1.3 
also supports negative magnitudes and crustal models from the HYPOELLIPSE program, 
including layer models, gradient over halfspace models, depths relative to sea level, 
negative depths above sea level, deep boreholes, and use of station elevations. It is Y2000 compatible.

<h3>Hypoinverse/Hyp2000_mgr Troubleshooting Tip:</h3>

If hyp2000_mgr dies mysteriously when reading its .hyp file, try running
the standalone interactive version of hyp2000. This will allow you to see
any error messages from hypoinverse, and it allows you to step through
a configuation one command at a time.<BR>
Just type <B>hyp2000</B> at a command prompt, and hypoinverse will give the prompt:<br>
<PRE>
COMMAND?
</PRE>
At this prompt, invoke a complete configuration file by entering 
<B>@configfile.hyp</B>. Or
type a hypoinverse's 3-letter command followed by Enter and hypoinverse
will prompt you for all the arguments for that command.  Entering each
command individually is a great way to find configuration errors!

<h3>Some changes of note for addition of Location Code:</h3>
<ol>
<li>
The "LET" command now requires five arguments:<br>
Number of letters in the site code (2-5)<br>
Number of letters in the net code (0-2)<br>
Number of letters in the component code (0-3)<br>
Number of letters in the location code in phase files (0-2)<br>
Number of letters in the location code in other files (0-2)<br>
Here's an example of a valid LET command for a .hyp file: <br>

<PRE>
LET 5 2 3 2 2
</PRE>
</ol>
</li>

<h3>Some changes of note for Hyp2000:</h3>
<ol>
<li>
Any format containing years is changed.  The changes are simple and
generally involve expanding years from 2 to 4 digits, and moving other
fields to the right.  The station file and shadow format had no year
field and therefore was not changed.  Hypoinverse summary format grows
from 154 to 164 columns, hypo71 from 93 to 95, archive format from 100
to 111, and summary shadow did not change length.
<li>
The exception to 1) is there is no new phase format.  The original
phase format is still supported, but the century (1900 or 2000) is set
as a global parameter for the location run.
<li>
All magnitudes are now to 2 decimal places in all formats
<li>
The user selects the 2000 formats with one command.  The "200"
command has 2 arguments:  a) T=use 2000 formats, F=use old formats  b)
Century to assume for phase format, which has no century field.  Thus
"cop 5" will still select archive-shadow input, which is useful to
those of us who struggle through earthquakes at 3 in the morning.
<li>
The new archive format has a field specifying a code for the units
of amplitude.  Presently only the traditional peak-to-peak mm
(Develocorder or paper), or 0-to-peak mm (UC Berkeley) are supported.
The amplitude field is expanded from F3.0 to F7.2.
