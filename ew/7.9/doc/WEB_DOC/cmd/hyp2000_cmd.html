<P>
Documentation for program hypoinverse can be requested from Fred Klein, USGS, Menlo Park, CA at klein@andreas.wr.usgs.gov.

IMPORTANT NOTE ON THE HYPOINVERSE COMMAND FILE
<P>
An example hypoinverse command file can be found in the example run directory, rum_test,  available from the Earthworm ftp site.  In order for HYPOINVERSE to run with Earthworm, the following command line MUST be in the HYPOINVERSE command file.
<PRE>
* Enable year 2000 formats
* ************************
200 T 1900 0

     This is a new command to hypoinverse that tells it what formats
  to expect.  It's "200" instead of "2000" because hypoinverse
  take 3-letter commands.  The default is "old" 2-digit year format.
     Does the fact that you see a 1900 on this line worry you?
  It shouldn't.  The 2nd & 3rd args to this command only apply when
  you're running "COP 1" (old phase) format input thru hypoinverse.
  Fred Klein put those in there to support an ancient format instead
  of changing that format.  Earthworm uses "COP 5" format.

IMPORTANT NOTE ON LOCATION CODES (EW v7.0 or greater):
</font>

<P> Here is a very important change for hyp2000 for Earthworm v7.0 and greater. With Location
codes, you need to provide 5 values for the LET command!. If you only provide 3 in windows,
the program will crash:

<PRE>
Here's what hyp2000 does now with LET:

ncss3> hyp2000
 HYPOINVERSE 2000 STARTING
 9/2005 VERSION (DUAL LOCATION CODES)
 COMMAND? let
 NUMBER OF LETTERS TO CHECK IN STATION SITE CODE (2-5) [cr = 4]?
 NUMBER OF LETTERS TO CHECK IN STATION NET CODE (0-2) [cr = 0]?
 NO. OF LETTERS TO CHECK IN STATION COMPONENT CODE (0-3) [cr = 0]?
 NO. OF LETS TO CHECK IN LOCATION CODE IN PHASE FILES (0-2) [cr = 0]?
 NO. OF LETS TO CHECK IN LOCATION CODE IN OTHER FILES (0-2) [cr = 0]?

So some good LET commands would be:
LET 5 2 3 2 2    # if you're using location codes
LET 5 2 3 0 0    # if you're NOT using location codes
