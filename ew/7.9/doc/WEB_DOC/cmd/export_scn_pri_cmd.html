   <H1>Export_scn_pri Configuration File</H1>

<H2>1.  EXAMPLE CONFIGURATION FILE</H2>

<pre>

#  export_scn_pri configuration file
#
#  This configuration is the same as for export_scn, excepting that it allows
#  priorities to be specified on the Send_scn command lines (at bottom).
#  Since export_scn will ignore the differences, the same configuration file
#  can be used with either module.
#
#  Exports messages from a given list of station/channel/network codes
#  Knows how to decipher TYPE_TRACEBUF, TYPE_PICK2K, TYPE_CODA2K msgs
#
#Background:
# Import/Export are the long-distance message transfer
# modules. They operate as one-on-one pairs. There are three variants of
# export: export_generic, which ships messages with specified logos, export_scn
# which ships only trace data, but with specified SCN names and export_scn_pri
# which behaves as export_scn, but also prioritizes SCNs for shipment.
#
# Import/Export send heartbeats to each other, as well as into their
# local earthworm systems. If the heartbeat from the distant partner is
# not received whithin the expected time period (RcvAliveInt) the link is
# terminated, and an attempt to reconnect is initiated. If things go
# seriously wrong, the heartbeat into the local earthworm system in
# stopped. The expectation is that "restartMe" has been set in the .desc
# file, and we'll be killed and restarted.
#
# All socket operations are performed with a timeout. This is noramlly
# defaulted, but can be set in this file (SocketTimeout).
#
# Export maintains a circular FIFO buffer of messages to be shipped. The
# size of this buffer (RingSize) controls the maximum latency of the
# data.
#
#
#Configuration notes:
#
# "restartMe" should be stated in our desc file.
#
# The period of our local heartbeat (HeartBeatInt) must be safely smaller
# (faster) than our advertised period in our .desc file (tsec:).
# Otherwise we'll get continually restarted for no good reason.
# Note that tsec:0 implies no heartbeats expected, and so we'll never get
# restarted.
#
# The rate at which we send heartbeats to our distant partner should be
# considerably faster than the rate at which our partner expects them.
# Otherwise, a heartbeat delayed in transmission will cause our partner to
# conclude that the link is broken, and cause them to break the link and
# reinitialize. Which will cause us to do the same.
#
# For export, the ServerIPAdr is  the address of the port to be used in
# the exporting machine.  This is to specify a network card case the
# exporting machine has several network cards.
#
# If SocketTimeout is specified, it should be at least as large as the
# expected period of heartbeats from our distant partner.
#
 MyModuleId     MOD_EXPORT_SCN_PRI  # module id for this program
 RingName       WAVE_RING           # transport ring to use for input/output
 HeartBeatInt   30                  # EW internal heartbeat interval (sec)
#                                     Should be >= RcvAliveInt
 LogFile        1                   # If 0, don't write logfile
#
# Logos of messages to export to client systems
#              Installation       Module       Message Type
 GetMsgLogo    INST_MENLO      MOD_WILDCARD     TYPE_TRACEBUF

# ServerIPAdr and ServerPort specify the local IP address and port number
# on which this module will be ready to accept a client connection.
#
 ServerIPAdr  aaa.bbb.cc.ddd   # Export messages via this ethernet card
 ServerPort     16005          # Well-known port number to export msgs on

 MaxMsgSize       900          # maximum size (bytes) for input/output msgs
 RingSize	  100	       # max# messages in outgoing circular msg buffer

 SendAliveText   "alive"       # string sent to client as heartbeat
 SendAliveInt      30          # seconds between alive msgs sent to client.
                               #  0=> no heartbeat
 RcvAliveText    "alive"       # text of client's heartbeat (we get this)
 RcvAliveInt       150         # seconds between client's heartbeats to us.
                               #  0 => no heartbeat
#
# Socket commands
#
 SocketTimeout 200000  # Timeout length in milliseconds for socket calls
                       # this should be atleast the value of the RcvAliveInt
 SocketDebug   0       # if 1, socket_ew debug statements are logged
                       # if 0, socket_ew debug is turned off
#
# List of station/channel/network codes to export
#
#  Export_scn_pri adds an option parameter for the priority as the last element
#  of the Send_scn command.  Valid values are 1 (highest) through 9 (lowest).
#  If any other value is found, or if the value is missing, then the default (9)
#  will be used.
#
Send_scn  JMP VFZ NC  1  # export waveforms from this station at priority 1 (highest)
Send_scn  JMP VFN NC  1  # export waveforms from this station at priority 1
Send_scn  JMP VFE NC  5  # export waveforms from this station at priority 5
Send_scn  JMP ASZ NC  3  # export waveforms from this station at priority 3
Send_scn  JMP ASN NC     # export waveforms from this station at default priority (9)
