<I>(last revised June 6, 2006)</I></CENTER>

<p>
This is the earthworm global phase picker intended for use with
glass.  It is based on Ray Buland's fortran originally developed
in the early 1980's.  Its unpublished and the details on how it
works are left as an exercise for the enterprising student.

Example configuration file raypicker.d:<br>
