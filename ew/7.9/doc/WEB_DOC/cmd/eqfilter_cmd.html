<p>eqfilter is the so called <i> garbage rejector </i>. That is it
performs sanity and authoritative region tests to hyp2000arc messages
found on the InRing and passes to the OutRing.  InRing and OutRing
can not be the same.

<p>
All tests are optional.  If a test is not configured then it is not
performed. If a test is configured then it must pass.  Tests are tied
to inst_id.  More or less all parameters in the hypo summary card may
be tested for.  Additionally, authoritative regions may be configured.
Minimum number of coda picks greater than zero for multiple magnitudes
may also be configured.

<p>
INST_WILDCARD is allowed.  If wildcard is the only institute configured
for a given test then arc messages from any installation will be tested
with those parameters.  If only specific installation is configured for
a given test, then only messages from that installation will be tested
for and all others will fail.  If a specific installation is configured
for a given test and wildcard is also configured for that test, then
messages from the specific will use those parameters, and all other
non-specified installations will use the wildcard params.

<P>
On startup, eqfilter reads the configuration file named on the command-line.
Commands in this file set up all parameters used in testing events for passing
to the clean ring.
In the control file, lines may begin with a valid eqfilter command (listed below)
or with one of 2 special
characters:
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
#  marks the line as a comment (example: # This is a comment).<BR>
@  allows control files to be nested; one control file can be
   accessed from another with the command "@" followed by
   a string representing the path name of the next control file
   (example: @model.d).
</BLOCKQUOTE></PRE>
Command names must be typed in the control file exactly as shown in this
document (upper/lower case matters!).

                             # passes this is logged, if it fails the test(s) which

#
# AllowUndefInst - OPTIONAL
#  Applies only to authreg test.
#  If this is uncommented, the TYPE_HYP2000ARC messages with installation
#  ID not listed in any InclRegion command below will be written to the
#  OutRing.  To prevent writing of messages with "unknown" installation
#  IDs, make sure that this options is NOT commented out.
#
AllowUndefInst

#
# List authoritative regions: at least one InclRegion keyword is required.
#  It associates an earthworm installation ID with a polygon (max 20 sides)
#  inside of which that installation is authoritative.
#    o An installation can have more than one authoritative region.
#    o A region can belong to more than one installation.
#
# The points of a polygon should be listed as if lines of the polygon
# were being drawn without lifting up the pencil, until the polygon
# is closed. Therefore, the first and the last point should be
# the same, and each two the points in between should be the ends
# of one side of the polygon.
#
# ExclRegion is optional. It allows for "holes" to be cut inside of the
# authoritative regions defined by InclRegion option.

<P>
In the following section, all configuration file commands are listed in alphabetical
order.  Listed along with the command (bold-type) are its arguments (in red)
and a description of the command.  There are no default values so if you
configure the command without arguments, all messages fail.

Command with no arguments and applies only to Authoritative Regions.
Any TYPE_HYP2000ARC messages with installation
