scn2scnl Configuration File</h1>
<i>(last revised 1 June 2006)</i> </center>
<p>scn2scnl is a module to convert TRACEBUF into TRACEBUF2 messages by
tacking on a location code. <br>
</p>
<p><br>
Below is a copy of the .d file with detailed notes on each
parameter:
</p>
<pre>#<br>#                     Configuration file for scn2scnl<br>#<br>MyModuleId     MOD_SCN2SCNL  # Module id for this instance of scn2scnl,<br>InRing         WAVE_RING     # Where to find input messages,<br>OutRing        WAVE_RING2    # Where to put output messages,<br>                             #  InRing and OutRing may be the same ring.<br>HeartbeatInt   15            # Heartbeat interval in secs<br>                             #   if 0, send no heartbeats<br><br># List SCN's that are to be converted and the SCNL to which they are to be<br># renamed. Format is:<br># SCN  sta chan net   sta chan net loc<br># You can list SCN's explicitly or with wildcards. The only supported wildcard<br># for station and network names is "*"; no other characters should be included<br># in a station or network name if the wildcard is used.<br># For channel names, you can use "*" or two letters followed by `?', as in <br># "HH?". The `?' wildcard is supported only as the third character of the<br># channel name.<br>#<br># The output SCNL must be given explicitly if the input SCNl is given<br># explicitly.<br># If a wildcard is used in the input SCN, you can use wildcards in the output <br># SCNL except in the location code. In the output SCNL, the wildcard means<br># "use whatever was in the input S, C or N".<br># <br># The explicit SCN's will be sorted with scn2scnl starts up so that a binary<br># search can be used to quickly find a match.<br># Incoming packets will be matched against this explicit list first. <br># Any packets that don't match an explicit SCN will then be matched against<br># the wildcarded SCNs in the order they appear in this file.<br># Any packets that do not match the wildcard list WILL NOT BE CONVERTED.<br># To ensure that all packets are converted, you should end the SCN list<br># with "SCN * * *  * * * --". This will assign the location code "--" to<br># any packets not otherwise matched.<br>SCN  * * *  * * * --<br></pre>
