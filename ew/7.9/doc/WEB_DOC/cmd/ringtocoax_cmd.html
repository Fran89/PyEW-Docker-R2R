<!-- ADD HERE: Paragraph "On startup, xxxx reads the..." -->
On startup, ringtocoax reads the configuration file named on the command
line.  Commands in this file set up all parameters used in reading Earthworm messages from shared memory and broadcasting them onto ethernet as UDP packets.
In the control file, lines may begin with a valid ringtocoax command
(listed below) or with one of 2 special characters:

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
#  marks the line as a comment (example: # This is a comment).<BR>
@  allows control files to be nested; one control file can be
   accessed from another with the command "@" followed by
   a string representing the path name of the next control file
   (example: @model.d).
</BLOCKQUOTE></PRE>
Command names must be typed in the control file exactly as shown in this
document (upper/lower case matters!).

#	*** WARNING ***
#	This module does connection-less broadcasts.
# 	In normal usage, it broadcasts onto an isolated, dedicated class b
#	subnet. There must be no routing to or from that subnet.
#	The broadcast is restricted to that subnet as stated below.
#	Note that the companion module, coaxtoring, has strange
#	system-specific addressing requirements

<!-- ADD HERE: all commands; below is a sample command blank: -->

<A NAME="BroadcastLogo">  <!-- command name as anchor inside quotes -->
<PRE><B>BroadcastLogo <font color=red>instid  modid  msgtype</font>	ringtocoax_config	msg handling</B><!-- command args ... -->
</PRE>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <!-- command description goes here -->
Specifies one message logo (<font color=red>instid</font>, <font color=red>modid</font>, and <font color=red>msgtype</font>) to read from
the shared memory region (named in the "RingName" command) and to broadcast onto
ethernet. The <font color=red>instid</font> must be a valid string in earthworm.h; <font color=red>modid</font> and <font color=red>msgtype</font>
must be valid strings in earthworm.d.
List one logo per "BroadcastLogo" command, and use as many commands as needed.
If  <font color=red>msgtype</font> is TYPE_HEARTBEAT or TYPE_ERROR, be sure that
the <A HREF=#CopyStatus>CopyStatus</A> value is non-zero.
If no "BroadcastLogo" command is given, ringtocoax defaults to
broadcasting all messages in the designated shared memory region.
<PRE><!-- Default and example go here   -->
Example:  BroadcastLogo INST_MENLO MOD_WILDCARD TYPE_TRACEBUF

<A NAME="BurstCount">  <!-- command name as anchor inside quotes -->
<PRE><B>BurstCount <font color=red>BurstCount</font>			ringtocoax_config	msg handling</B><!-- command args ... -->
</PRE>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <!-- command description goes here -->
Defines the number of UDP packets, <font color=red>BurstCount</font>, in a broadcast "burst".   Three commands, <font color=blue>"BurstCount"</font>, <A HREF=#SqrtCount>"SqrtCount"</A>, and <A HREF=#BurstInterval>"BurstInterval"</A>, control the temporal
spacing of UDP packets broadcast by ringtocoax.  Ringtocoax broadcasts messages in groups
of <font color=red>BurstCount</font> packets; between the packets within a "burst",
ringtocoax loops thru <font color=red>SqrtCount</font> square root calculations to waste a little time.  After broadcasting a "burst" of packets, ringtocoax
sleeps for <font color=red>BurstInterval</font> milliseconds, then it starts sending
the next burst. The goal of spacing packets a
tiny bit in time is to give the receiving program a better chance of catching every
packet.
<P>
UDP packets are variable in length up to a maximum of 1472 bytes (6 bytes of header, 1466 bytes of data).  If an Earthworm message has a length
less than or equal to 1466 bytes, it will be broadcast in a single UDP packet.
If an Earthworm message is longer
than 1466 bytes, it will be fragmented by ringtocoax, broadcast in multiple UDP packets, and reassembled by the receiving program (coaxtoring).
Ringtocoax will never pack more than one Earthworm message in a single UDP packet.
<P>
It is very important that the overall rate of broadcast is as at least as fast
as the rate of local information production. For example, if your system produces 256 TYPE_TRACEBUF messages per second (464 bytes each = 1 UDP packet each), then the <font color=red>BurstCount</font>, <font color=red>SqrtCount</font>, and <font color=red>BurstInterval</font> commands should
be configured such that ringtocoax will broadcast at least 256 UDP packets per second.
System clock resolution must be considered when configuring the three commands,
especially <font color=red>BurstInterval</font>.
As of April 1999, the time resolution of each sleep on Windows NT is about 16 msec (one clock
tick).  On Solaris, the resolution is about 10 msec.

<A NAME="BurstInterval">  <!-- command name as anchor inside quotes -->
<PRE><B>BurstInterval <font color=red>BurstInterval</font>			ringtocoax_config	msg handling</B><!-- command args ... -->
</PRE>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <!-- command description goes here -->
Defines the minimum interval, in milliseconds, between "bursts" of UDP broadcasts.
See the <A HREF=#BurstCount>BurstCount</A> command for a detailed description of ringtocoax's broadcasting scheme.
<font color=red>BurstInterval</font> must be a number greater than or equal to zero.
Remember to consider the system clock resolution when configuring <font color=red>BurstInterval</font>.
As of April 1999, the clock-tick resolution is about 16 msec on Windows NT, and
about 10 msec on Solaris.

<PRE><B>CopyStatus <font color=red>CopyStatus</font>				ringtocoax_config	msg handling</B><!-- command args ... -->
</PRE>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <!-- command description goes here -->
Sets the <font color=red>CopyStatus</font> switch to control whether ringtocoax broadcasts
TYPE_ERROR and TYPE_HEARTBEAT messages.  If no "BroadcastLogo" command is present,
then ringtocoax will default to reading all messages in the shared memory region specified by the "RingName" command.  If <font color=red>CopyStatus</font> is non-zero, all of these messages will
be broadcast onto ethernet.  If <font color=red>CopyStatus</font> is 0, TYPE_HEARTBEAT and
TYPE_ERROR will not be broadcast, but all other messages will.
<PRE><!-- Default and example go here   -->
Default:  none

<A NAME="HeartBeatInterval">  <!-- command name as anchor inside quotes -->
<PRE><B>HeartBeatInterval <font color=red>nsec</font> 			ringtocoax_config	Earthworm setup</B><!-- command args ... -->
</PRE>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <!-- command description goes here -->
Defines the number of seconds <font color=red>nsec</font> between TYPE_HEARTBEAT messages
issued by ringtocoax.

<A NAME="LogSwitch">  <!-- command name as anchor inside quotes -->
<PRE><B>LogSwitch <font color=red>switch</font>			ringtocoax_config	output</B><!-- command args ... -->
</PRE>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <!-- command description goes here -->
Sets the on-off switch for writing a log file to disk.  If <font color=red>switch</font>
is 0, no log file will be written.  If <font color=red>switch</font> is 1, ringtocoax
will write a daily log file(s) called ringtocoaxxx.log_ccyymmdd
where xx is ringtocoax's module id (set with "MyModName" command)
and ccyymmdd is the current UTC date (ex: 19990123) on the system clock.
The file(s) will be written in the EW_LOG directory (environment
variable).

<PRE><B>MaxLogo <font color=red>nlogo</font>				ringtocoax_config	msg handling</B><!-- command args ... -->
</PRE>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <!-- command description goes here -->
Sets the maximum number, <font color=red>nlogo</font>, of different message logos that
ringtocoax can process.  Ringtocoax assigns a sequence number
(unsigned char) to each message based on its logo before it broadcasts
the message.  Space is allocated to store the last sequence number
used for up to <font color=red>nlogo</font> different logos.  If the tracking arrays are
full and ringtocoax gets a never-seen-before message logo from shared
memory, ringtocoax will not broadcast that message, but it will issue
a TYPE_ERROR message explaining the problem.

<PRE><B>MsgMaxBytes <font color=red>nbytes</font>			ringtocoax_config	msg handling</B><!-- command args ... -->
</PRE>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <!-- command description goes here -->
Sets the size, in bytes, of the buffer that ringtocoax uses for
storing Earthworm messages read from shared memory.  <font color=red>nbytes</font> should
be the size of the largest message you expect ringtocoax to receive.
If ringtocoax receives a message larger than <font color=red>nbytes</font>, it will drop
the entire message and issue a TYPE_ERROR message containing the
string "too big for Buffer" and the logo of the dropped message.

<BLOCKQUOTE> <!-- command description goes here -->
Sets the module id for labeling all outgoing heartbeat and error
messages.  <font color=red>mod_id</font> is a character string (valid strings are listed
in earthworm.d) that relates (in earthworm.d) to a unique single-byte
number.  All messages that ringtocoax receives from shared memory are
tagged with their original logos when they are broadcast onto ethernet.

</PRE>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <!-- command description goes here -->
Tells ringtocoax the TCP/IP address of the ethernet line onto which
it should broadcast Earthworm messages. <font color=red>a.b.c.d</font> is a character
string in tcp/ip's standard dotted-decimal notation that ringtocoax
uses along with the port number from the "OutPortNumber" command to
set up a socket to which it will broadcast UDP Datagram packets.
By convention, all Earthworm broadcasts have the node ("d" part of
address) set to 255 (for example a.b.c.255).

<PRE><B>OutPortNumber <font color=red>port</font>			ringtocoax_config	network info</B><!-- command args ... -->
</PRE>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <!-- command description goes here -->
Defines the well-known port number <font color=red>port</font> to be used by ringtocoax for
broadcasting.  <font color=red>port</font> is an integer that ringtocoax uses along with
the address from the "OutAddress" command to set up a socket to which
it will broadcast UDP Datagram packets.
<BR>
<font color=red>NOTE:</font> The port number must be greater than 1024.
Smaller port numbers require root permission.

<BLOCKQUOTE> <!-- command description goes here -->
Tells ringtocoax which shared memory region to use for input/output.
<font color=red>ring</font> is a character string (valid strings are listed in earthworm.d)
that relates (in earthworm.d) to a unique number for the key to the
shared memory region.  All messages that ringtocoax reads from shared
memory are tagged with their original logos when they are broadcast
onto ethernet.
