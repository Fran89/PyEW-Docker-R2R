scnl2scn Configuration File</h1>
<i>(last revised 28 December 2006)</i> </center>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">scnl2scn</span> is a module to
convert TRACEBUF2 into TRACEBUF messages by mapping SCNLs into SCNs. <br>
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">BE VERY CAREFUL </span>with this
module as this could cause DUPLICATE WAVEFORM messages if 2 components
have the same channel name but different location codes.<br>
</p>
<p><br>
&nbsp;Below is a copy of the .d file with detailed notes on each
parameter:

			     # logs every SCNL is sees!<br># List SCNL's that are to be converted and the SCN to which they are to be<br># renamed. Format is:<br># SCNL  sta chan net loc   sta chan net<br># You can list SCNL's explicitly or with wildcards. The only supported wildcard<br># for station and network names is "*"; no other characters should be included<br># in a station, network or location name if the wildcard is used.<br># For channel names, you can use "*" or two letters followed by `?', as in <br># "HH?". The `?' wildcard is supported only as the third character of the<br># channel name.<br>#<br># The output SCN must be given explicitly if the input SCNL is given<br># explicitly.<br># If a wildcard is used in the input SCNL, you can use wildcards in the output.<br># In the output SCN, the wildcard means "use whatever was in the <br># input S, C or N".<br># <br># The explicit SCNL's will be sorted with scnl2scn starts up so that a binary<br># search can be used to quickly find a match.<br># Incoming packets will be matched against this explicit list first. <br># Any packets that don't match an explicit SCNL will then be matched against<br># the wildcarded SCNLs in the order they appear in this file.<br># Any packets that do not match the wildcard list WILL NOT BE CONVERTED.<br># To ensure that all packets are converted, you could end the SCNL list<br># with "SCNL * * * *  * * *". This will simply delete the location code from<br># any packets not otherwise matched.<br># Be careful with this, however. It may cause multiple SCNLs to be converted<br># into a single SCN, producing utter garbage!<br>SCNL  * * * *  * * *
