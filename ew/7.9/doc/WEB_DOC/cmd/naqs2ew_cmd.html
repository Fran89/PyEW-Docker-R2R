                       # (it's in the future) and it ignores the entire packet.
                       # NOTE: if you use this feature with small tolerances,
                       # the PC's system clock must be kept pretty close to
                       # network time!!!
                       # Set to -1 if you never want to compare packet times
                       # to the system clock.
                       # Valid values are -1 or any number >= 0.0

# Set up list of channels you want to receive from NaqsServer using
# a 'RequestChannel' command for each channel, with these arguments:
#
#   sta       station code you want to receive data from (no wildcards).
#   comp      component (channel) of data you want to receive (no wildcards).
#   net       2-character network code to label this channel with (no wildcards).
#             NaqsServer supplies its own station and component codes to its clients,
#             but not a network code. The sta and comp codes you supply in this file
#             must match the codes supplied by NaqsServer. The TYPE_TRACEBUF messages
#             output to the Earthworm system will be labeled with the sta, comp, net
#             codes listed in this file.
#
#   pinno     pin number to assign to this channel (0-32767)
#
#   delay     short-term-completion time (in seconds) -1s <= s <= 300s.
#             When NaqsServer misses packets from the field, it will wait for the
#             given amount of time for the gap to be filled by re-transmitted
#             packets before sending data to naqs2ew. Specifying delay=0 will
#             guarantee that packets are in chronological order, without
#             waiting for missed data.  Setting delay=-1 will deliver the packets
#             with no delay, in the order they were received (possibly out of
#             chronological order).
#
#   format    format in which you want to receive the data:
#              -1   = compressed packets (raw format from HRD)
#               0   = uncompressed packets, original sample rate.
#             0 < r = requested output sample rate.  NaqsServer will accomodate.
#
#   sendbuf   Buffer flag:
#               0 = do not send buffered packets for these channels.
#               1 = send buffered packets for these channels.  This effectively
#                   moves the start of the data stream several packets into
#                   the past.
#             WARNING: if naqs2ew is auto-restarted with sendbuf = 1,
#               duplicate data could enter the Earthworm system.
#               Therefore, we strongly recommend setting sendbuf = 0.

<A NAME="Debug">  <!-- command name as anchor inside quotes -->
<PRE><B>Debug <font color=red>flag</font></B>							Output Control
</PRE>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <!-- command description goes here -->
Optional command to control the amount of logging done by naqs2ew.
If <font color=red>flag</font> is zero, debug-level logging is turned off;
naqs2ew will do normal logging of start, stop, and error conditions.
If <font color=red>flag</font> is non-zero, naqs2ew will also make a line entry
for every packet it sends and receives, and it will log the entire contents
of every decompressed trace data packet.

<BLOCKQUOTE> <!-- command description goes here -->
Defines the minimum number of seconds <font color=red>nsec</font> between
TYPE_HEARTBEAT messages issued by naqs2ew. The heartbeat is
implemented within both the connection-making and the socket-reading
loops of naqs2ew.

<A NAME="LogFile">  <!-- command name as anchor inside quotes -->
<PRE><B>LogFile <font color=red>switch</font></B>							Output Control
</PRE>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <!-- command description goes here -->
Sets the on-off switch for writing a log file to disk.  If <font color=red>switch</font>
is 0, no log file will be written, but messages may go to stderr and/or stdout.
If <font color=red>switch</font> is 1, naqs2ew
will write to stderr/stdout and to a daily log file(s) called naqs2ewxx.log_ccyymmdd
where xx is naqs2ew's module id (set with "MyModuleId" command)
and ccyymmdd is the current UTC date (ex: 19960123) on the system clock.
The file(s) will be written in the EW_LOG directory (environment
variable).  If <font color=red>switch</font> is 2, the log file will be written, but
no messages will go to stderr or stdout.

<A NAME="MaxSamplePerMsg">  <!-- command name as anchor inside quotes -->
<PRE><B>MaxSamplePerMsg <font color=red>nsamp</font></B>						Waveform Acquisition
</PRE>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <!-- command description goes here -->
Sets the maximum length of each outgoing TYPE_TRACEBUF message to <font color=red>nsamp</font> samples. The number of samples in each TYPE_TRACEBUF message depends on the sample rate of the channel. Normally naqs2ew loads one-second's worth of data into each TYPE_TRACEBUF message.  However, if the sample rate for
a channel is greater than <font color=red>nsamp</font> samples per second, naqs2ew
limits that channel's TYPE_TRACEBUF messages to <font color=red>nsamp</font> samples each.
In processing a packet from NaqsServer, naqs2ew will buffer any fractional second of data until it receives the next packet for that channel in an attempt to always send out
equal length messages.
If naqs2ew detects a time tear between packets from NaqsServer, it may output a message containing less than one second of data.

<BLOCKQUOTE> <!-- command description goes here -->
Sets the module id for labeling all outgoing messages. <font color=red>mod_id</font> is
a character string (valid strings are listed in earthworm.d) that
relates (in earthworm.d) to a unique single-byte number.

<BLOCKQUOTE> <!-- command description goes here -->
Tells naqs2ew which shared memory region to use for output. <font color=red>ring</font>
is a character string (valid strings are listed in earthworm.d) that relates (in earthworm.d)
to a unique number for the key to the shared memory region.

<A NAME="RequestChannel">  <!-- command name as anchor inside quotes -->
<PRE><B>RequestChannel <font color=red>sta comp net pinno delay format sendbuf</font></B>		Waveform Acquisition
</PRE>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <!-- command description goes here -->
Use one RequestChannel command for each channel of trace data that you want to
request from NaqsServer (no hard-coded limit).  Details of the arguments
are given below:
<PRE>
  <font color=red>sta</font>       station code you want to receive data from (up to 5 chars, no wildcards).

  <font color=red>comp</font>      component (channel) of data you want to receive (up to 3 chars, no wildcards).

  <font color=red>net</font>       network code to label this channel with (up to 2 chars,no wildcards).
            NaqsServer supplies its own station and component codes to its clients,
            but not a network code. The <font color=red>sta</font> and <font color=red>comp</font> codes you supply in this command
            must match the codes supplied by NaqsServer. The TYPE_TRACEBUF messages
            output to the Earthworm system will be labeled with the <font color=red>sta, comp, net</font>
            codes listed in this command.

  <font color=red>pinno</font>     pin number to assign to this channel (0-32767)

  <font color=red>delay</font>     short-term-completion time (in seconds) -1s <= s <= 300s.
            When NaqsServer misses packets from the field, it will wait for the
            given amount of time for the gap to be filled by re-transmitted
            packets before sending data to naqs2ew. Specifying <font color=red>delay</font> = 0 will
            guarantee that packets are in chronological order, without
            waiting for missed data.  Setting <font color=red>delay</font> = -1 will deliver the packets
            with no delay, in the order they were received (possibly out of
            chronological order).

  <font color=red>format</font>    format in which you want to receive the data from NaqsServer:
               -1   = compressed packets (raw format from HRD)
                0   = uncompressed packets, original sample rate.
              0 < r = requested output sample rate.  NaqsServer will accomodate.
            Data is reformatted into Earthworm TYPE_TRACEBUF packets before it is
            written to the transport ring.

  <font color=red>sendbuf</font>   Buffer flag:
                0 = do not send buffered packets for these channels.
                1 = send buffered packets for these channels.  This effectively
                    moves the start of the data stream several packets into
                    the past.
            WARNING: if naqs2ew is auto-restarted with <font color=red>sendbuf</font> = 1,
              duplicate data could enter the Earthworm system (this is generally not
              a good thing). Therefore, we strongly recommend setting <font color=red>sendbuf</font> = 0.

Default:  none
Example:  RequestChannel  CSU1 VDN NC 2002  30  0  0

<A NAME="SocketDebug">  <!-- command name as anchor inside quotes -->
<PRE><B>SocketDebug <font color=red>flag</font></B>						Output Control
</PRE>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <!-- command description goes here -->
Optional command to control the amount of logging done by the socket library.
If <font color=red>flag</font> is zero, debug-level logging is turned off.
If <font color=red>flag</font> is non-zero, the socket library write LOTS of
debugging info. WARNING: turing socket debugging on generates huge log files.
<PRE><!-- Default and example go here   -->
Default:  SocketDebug 0
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>

<A NAME="TimeJumpTolerance">  <!-- command name as anchor inside quotes -->
<PRE><B>TimeJumpTolerance <font color=red>flag</font></B>						Waveform Acquisition
</PRE>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <!-- command description goes here -->
(in seconds) This term is used to catch packets with dubious timestamps.
If a time gap is detected in an incoming data stream, the new packet's
timestamp is compared to the system clock.  If it is later than
the current system time by more than TimeJumpTolerance
seconds, naqs2ew assumes the packet timestamp is bogus
(it's in the future) and it ignores the entire packet.
NOTE: if you use this feature with small tolerances,
the PC's system clock must be kept pretty close to
network time!!!
Set to -1 if you never want to compare packet times
to the system clock.
Valid values are -1 or any number >= 0.0
