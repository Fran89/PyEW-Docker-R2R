<CENTER><H1>RCV_ew Configuration</H1>
<I>(last revised 16 April 1998)</I></CENTER>

Rcv_ew receives triggered or continuous trace data from one or more USNSN
stations (collected in Golden, Colorado), reformats the data into standard
Earthworm TYPE_TRACEBUF format and places it in an Earthworm transport ring.
For each channel, the trace data output by rcv_ew will be chronological.
There will be no overlap between successive data messages, but there may be
gaps. The messages will likely be of variable length, with a maximum length
set by the user.
<P>

Rcv_ew is a composite Earthworm module. It is made up of two USNSN programs
(RCV and STATION, written and maintained by Dave Ketchum) that call a set of
user functions (written by Lynn Dietz) which contain all the Earthworm-specific
code.  RCV handles the communication with the USNSN in Golden, receiving
USNSN packets via a TCP/IP socket or a satellite. RCV spawns the STATION
process at the end of a pipe and passes data packets to it. STATION processes
the data packets and handles all the Earthworm communications by calls to the
user functions. RCV and STATION are configured with command-line switches.
The Earthworm user functions are configured with an Earthworm-style
configuration file.  In the following sections, we describe the configuration
options for the components of rcv_ew:

<H2>1.  RCV COMMAND-LINE SWITCHES</H2>
<P>
The RCV command line is the only command line listed for this module in
startstop's configuration file.  This command line must contain all of the
switches for both RCV and STATION, as well as the name of the Earthworm
configuration file.  RCV spawns STATION, passing it the complete list of
command switches that it started with. STATION then calls the user_proc_cmd
function and passes it the configuration file name.  Each process ignores
the other's switches when it configures itself.  Here we list only the
command line switches used by RCV:
<PRE>
  -tcp          Use TCP/IP socket to NSN3.CR.USGS.GOV to get data.
                Use of the -tcp switch excludes use of the -i switch.

  -i pathname   Use the pathname as the device to obtain serial data from
                (-i /dev/ttya).  Use of the -i switch excludes use of
                the -tcp switch.

  -o path       Open file "path" for writing log output to. The size of this
                file is unbounded. If -o is omitted, all log output will be
                written to stdout.

  -!            Turn on debugging print statements (usually used only in testing).

  -$            Turn on force rollback flag (usually used only in testing).

<A NAME="sta">
<H2>2.  STATION COMMAND-LINE SWITCHES</H2>
<P>
The RCV command line is the only command line listed for this module in
startstop's configuration file.  This command line must contain all of the
switches for both RCV and STATION, as well as the name of the Earthworm
configuration file.  RCV spawns STATION, passing it the
complete list of command switches that it started with.  Then STATION calls
the user_proc_cmd() function and passes it the configuration file name.
Each process ignores the other's switches when it configures itself.  Here
we list only the command line switches used by STATION:
<PRE>
  -# Nch        Send multiple channels to one STATION, Nch is max # channels.
                STATION will use the last channel slot for any new channel
                that comes in after all of the channel slots are full. Since
                unexpected channels sometimes slip thru from Golden, it is
                recommended that Nch be greater than the number of channels
                you have arranged to receive.
                Under Earthworm, this argument is required.

  -partial      Call user_proc with incremental updates on "partial" update
                packets. The default behavior is to wait for a complete
                USNSN packet to come in before submitting it to user_proc.
                This allows NSN LH* channels to be processed every two
                minutes or so instead of about once per 20-40 minutes.
                Under Earthworm, the -partial argument must be omitted.

  -s            Open a log file for each STATION process. The name of the
                log file is based on the station name being processed by each
                instance of STATION. If -# is used, the log file will be named
                "station.log". The file(s) will be written in the directory
                from which RCV/STATION was started (under Earthworm, this will
                be the EW_PARAMS directory). If the -s switch omitted, no log
                file will be created; all log output will be written to stdout.
                NOTE: the log file size is unbounded; it tends to get very
                      large very quickly.
                      We recommend running without -s argument.

  -e config     Names the Earthworm configuration file "config" to be read
                in the user_proc_cmd() function.  This switch is valid only
                in the Earthworm impletmentation of rcv_ew.
                Under Earthworm, this argument is required.

  -dbg          Turns on debugging (not usually used by users).

</PRE>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <!-- command description goes here -->
Describes one of the channels of waveform data that rcv_ew expects
to receive from the USNSN.  <font color=red>site</font> is the channel's SEED site code
(up to 6 chars), <font color=red>comp</font> is the SEED component code (up to 8 chars),
and <font color=red>net</font> is the channel's network code (up to 8 chars).  <font color=red>pinno</font> is
a number (0-32767) which will be included in the "pinno" field of the
Earthworm-formatted waveform message header.  This number will be
meaningful only to the local installation (other installations may apply
a different <font color=red>pinno</font> to the same data stream).  You must list an
"AcceptSCN" command for each channel that you expect to get from the USNSN.
Rcv_ew will ignore data from any channel that is not listed in an
"AcceptSCN" command, issuing an error message that it is doing so.
The total number of "AcceptSCN" commands that can be listed is limited
to "Nch" as set in STATION's "-# Nch" command-line switch.

<BLOCKQUOTE> <!-- command description goes here -->
Sets the minimum number of seconds <font color=red>nsec</font> between TYPE_HEARTBEAT
messages issued by rcv_ew.  The heartbeat function (user_heart_beat)
is entered whenever data or keepalive messages are received from Golden.
A heartbeat will be issued only if at least <font color=red>nsec</font> seconds have elapsed
since the last heartbeat.  Since data arrives at irregular intervals,
the actual heartbeat interval will be irregular.  At a minimum, Golden
sends a keepalive once every minute.  To guarantee that rcv_ew issues a
heartbeat for every keepalive received, set <font color=red>nsec</font> to something less
than 60 seconds (even so, an interval between heartbeats from a properly
operating rcv_ew could be as long as <font color=red>nsec</font>+60-1 seconds).

Sets the on-off switch for writing an Earthworm log file to disk.
If <font color=red>switch</font> is 0, no log file will be written.  If <font color=red>switch</font> is 1,
rcv_ew will write a daily log file(s) called rcv_ewxx.log_yymmdd
where xx is rcv_ew's module id (set with "MyModuleId" command)
and yymmdd is the current UTC date (ex: 960123) on the system clock.
The file(s) will be written in the EW_LOG directory (environment
variable). <BR>
NOTE: this log file contains information from only the Earthworm
portion of rcv_ew.  It is separate from the log files written  by the USNSN code, RCV and STATION (see -o and -s command-line switches).

<BLOCKQUOTE> <!-- command description goes here -->
Sets the maximum number of samples, <font color=red>nsamp</font>, to pack into each outgoing
TYPE_TRACEBUF message.  Each sample is stored as a 4-byte integer, in
local byte order.  The byte-order is recorded in the "datatype" field
of the tracebuf header.  An <font color=red>nsamp</font> of 1008 will yield the largest
allowed TYPE_TRACEBUF message (64 byte header + 4032 bytes of data).
Some TYPE_TRACEBUF messages output by rcv_ew will contain fewer than

Sets a time limit for reporting silent stations (long data gaps).
If rcv_ew does not receive any data for a given channel for <font color=red>nmin</font>
minutes, it will issue an error message saying "No data from S C N in
xx minutes."  Rcv_ew will continue to issue an error every additional
<font color=red>nmin</font> minutes that no data comes in.  When rcv_ew starts receiving
data for that channel again, it will issue an "un-error" message saying
"Once again receiving data from S C N."  If <font color=red>nmin</font> is zero, rcv_ew will
not issue any messages about long data gaps.

<PRE><B>PacketLatency <font color=red>npkt</font>			rcv_ew_config		Waveform I/O</B><!-- command args ... -->
</PRE>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <!-- command description goes here -->
Sets the number of USNSN packets to buffer for each channel before
releasing one.  This buffering gives rcv_ew a chance to resequence
packets after a rollback (when packets are re-sent due to detected
communication problems), allowing corrected data instead of possibly
corrupted data to be released.  <font color=red>npkt</font> must be between 0 and 8,
inclusive. Rcv_ew will not output any data for a given channel until
after <font color=red>npkt</font> packets have been received.  Once the buffer is full,
rcv_ew will release the oldest packet on receipt of a new, in-sequence
packet. If rcv_ew gets an out-of-sequence packet with an earlier-than-
expected timestamp (a rollback packet), it looks through that channel's
buffer for a packet with an identical sequence number. If such a packet
is found, rcv_ew overwrites it with the newly received packet.
Otherwise, rcv_ew issues a "Rollback cannot be used" error, and
discards the new packet.  If rcv_ew gets an out-of-sequence packet with
a later-than-expected timestamp, it issues a "Gap prior to seq=x" error,
and buffers the new packet for later release. When rcv_ew gets a packet
marked "end-of-trace-segment" (triggered data), it releases all packets
in the buffer for that channel (who knows how long it will be until the
next trigger occurs?).  If <font color=red>npkt</font> is set to zero, no packets will be
buffered; they will be released as soon as they are received and any
rollbacks will be ignored.

<A NAME="seed">
<H2>4.  SEED CHANNEL NAME FILE</H2>
<P>
RCV and STATION (as well as other USNSN and IRIS codes) use get_name() to
get SEED names for channels. This function requires that a file named
<font color=green>nsnstation2.dat</font> reside in the directory in which the program was started.  A sample of this file is included in rcv_ew's source
directory .../vX.X/src/rcv.
The best way to get the most up-to-date station list from Golden is to use
the autodrm.  Send a mail message to
