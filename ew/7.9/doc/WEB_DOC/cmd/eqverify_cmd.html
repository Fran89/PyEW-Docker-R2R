<!-- ADD HERE: Paragraph "On startup, xxxx reads the..." -->
On startup, eqverify reads the configuration file named on the command-line.
Commands in this file set up all parameters used in verifying events to be
earthquakes.  In the control file, lines may begin with a valid eqverify
command (listed below) or with one of 2 special characters:

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
#  marks the line as a comment (example: # This is a comment).<BR>
@  allows control files to be nested; one control file can be
   accessed from another with the command "@" followed by
   a string representing the path name of the next control file
   (example: @model.d).
</BLOCKQUOTE></PRE>
Command names must be typed in the control file exactly as shown in this
document (upper/lower case matters!).

<!-- ADD HERE: Paragraph "Below are the commands recognized..." -->
Below are the commands recognized by eqverify, grouped by the function they
influence.  Some of the commands are marked "required"; these commands must
be specified in the control file in order for eqverify to operate.  Other
commands have default values which are over-ridden when a command is given.

<H2>3.  ALPHABETIC COMMAND LISTING & DESCRIPTION</H2>
<P>
In the following section, all configuration file commands are listed
in alphabetical order.  Listed along with the command (bold-type) are
its arguments (in red), the name of the subroutine that processes the
command, and the function within the module that the command influences.
A detailed description of the command and is also given.  Default values
and the values used by Calnet are listed after each command description.

<!-- ADD HERE: all commands; below is a sample command blank: -->

<A NAME="coda_clip">  <!-- command name as anchor inside quotes -->
<PRE><B>coda_clip <font color=red>klipc</font>				eqverify_config		verification</B><!-- command args ... -->
</PRE>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <!-- command description goes here -->
Define the number of counts <font color=red>klipc</font> above which a 2-second trace data
window's average absolute amplitude should be considered clipped.
Eqcoda also uses the "coda_clip" command; make sure that both eqcoda
and eqverify are using the same value for <font color=red>klipc</font>!  Eqverify uses
<font color=red>klipc</font> in calculating an eqmeas-style coda weight that is used in
the coda weight test (see "test_codawt" command).  This coda weight
is slightly different than that calculated by eqcoda.
<PRE><!-- Default and example go here   -->
Default:  coda_clip 820			Calnet:  coda_clip 820

<PRE><B>define_glitch <font color=red>npick</font> <font color=red>nsec</font>		eqverify_config		verification</B><!-- command args ... -->
</PRE>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <!-- command description goes here -->
Defines a glitch as at least <font color=red>npick</font> arrivals within <font color=red>nsec</font> seconds.
This definition is used in the test on the temporal distribution of
P-arrivals (see "test_pgroup" command for an explanation).<BR>
<B>Note:</B> <font color=red>nsec</font> should be set slightly larger than an integer multiple
of the pick-timing resolution to avoid missing glitches due to
round-off errors in floating point arithmetic (for example, our
picks are reported to the nearest 0.01 seconds, so we set <font color=red>nsec</font>
to 0.035 sec instead of 0.03 sec).

<A NAME="EventThreshold">  <!-- command name as anchor inside quotes -->
<PRE><B>EventThreshold <font color=red>thresh</font>			eqverify_config		verification</B><!-- command args ... -->
</PRE>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <!-- command description goes here -->
Sets the event weight <font color=red>thresh</font> below which an event is a verified
earthquake.  Each event begins with an event weight of zero (perfect
event).  Up to four tests (see "test_*" commands) may be performed to
verify that the event has the characteristics of a real earthquake.
Three of the tests evaluate coda characteristics, and the other
evaluates the temporal distribution of P-arrivals.  Each test
increments the event weight if non-earthquake characteristics are
detected.  If the event weight is equal to or greater than <font color=red>thresh</font>
after all the tests are performed, the event is declared noise and
is written to eqverify's log file.  Events with weights less than
<font color=red>thresh</font> are piped to the next process.

<PRE><B>force_report <font color=red>npick</font> <font color=red>mag</font>			eqverify_config		verification</B><!-- command args ... -->
</PRE>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <!-- command description goes here -->
Sets a safety-valve to force large events to be reported regardless
of their final event weight.  An event with more than <font color=red>npick</font> arrivals
and a magnitude of at least <font color=red>mag</font> will always be sent along to the
next process, even if its event weight exceeds the event threshold
<font color=red>thresh</font>.  The event's magnitude is calculated from its median coda
duration.  This safety-valve is necessary for large events because
the picker terminates coda calculations at 144 seconds, before the
coda begins to decay.  This causes the test described in the
"test_slopevsmag" command to yield results that would call the event
noise.  And we don't want a real large earthquake to be thrown away!<BR>
<B>Note:</B> defaults were taken from Lindh and Hirshorn's program, eqmeas.

<PRE><B>LogFile <font color=red>switch</font>				eqverify_config		output</B><!-- command args ... -->
</PRE>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <!-- command description goes here -->
Sets the on-off switch for writing a log file to disk.  If <font color=red>switch</font>
is 0, no log file will be written.  If <font color=red>switch</font> is 1, eqverify will
write daily log file(s) called eqverifyxx.log_yymmdd where xx is
eqverify's module id (set with "MyModuleId" command) and yymmdd is the
current UTC date (ex: 960123) on the system clock.  The file(s) will
be written in the EW_LOG directory (environment variable).

<PRE><B>MaxDeltaT <font color=red>sec</font>				eqverify_config		verification</B><!-- command args ... -->
</PRE>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <!-- command description goes here -->
Defines the time interval for studying the temporal distribution of
P-arrivals (see "test_pgroup" command).  Only picks within <font color=red>sec</font>
seconds of the first-arriving pick are considered in the test.
<PRE><!-- Default and example go here   -->

<BLOCKQUOTE> <!-- command description goes here -->
Sets the module id for labeling all outgoing messages. <font color=red>mod_id</font> is
a character string (valid strings are listed in earthworm.d) that
relates (in earthworm.d) to a unique single-byte number.<BR>
<B>NOTE:</B> eqverify is part of a mega-module which is ultimately started by
the program eqproc.  All sub-modules of this megamodule should be
given the same module id.

<PRE><B>PipeTo <font color=red>cmdstring</font>			eqverify_config		Earthworm setup</B><!-- command args ... -->
</PRE>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <!-- command description goes here -->
Sets the command to which eqverify will pipe a hypoinverse-format
archive (with shadow cards) event for the next step in earthquake
processing.  Blank spaces are allowed in <font color=red>cmdstring</font> as long as
the entire command is enclosed in double-quotes.

<PRE><B>test_codawt <font color=red>switch</font>			eqverify_config		verification</B><!-- command args ... -->
</PRE>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <!-- command description goes here -->
Sets the switch for performing the coda weight test on each event.
If <font color=red>switch</font> is non-zero, the test will be performed; if <font color=red>switch</font> is
zero, it will not be performed.  This test, taken from Lindh and
Hirshorn's program eqmeas, calculates a coda weight for each pick in
the manner of eqmeas.  It then finds the average of all coda weights
for the event and adds this average value to the event weight.
<PRE><!-- Default and example go here   -->
Default:  none				Calnet:  test_codawt 1
</PRE>

<A NAME="test_freefitrms">  <!-- command name as anchor inside quotes -->
<PRE><B>test_freefitrms <font color=red>switch</font>			eqverify_config		verification</B><!-- command args ... -->
</PRE>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <!-- command description goes here -->
Sets the switch for performing a test on the rms values from free-fit
slopes to the coda average absolute values.  If <font color=red>switch</font> is non-zero,
the test will be performed; if <font color=red>switch</font> is zero, it will not be
performed.  This test, taken from Lindh and Hirshorn's program eqmeas,
considers only the rms for each arrival where at least 3 coda window
average absolute values were used in the free-fit.  It finds the median
of all such free-fit rms's for the event.  If the median rms value is
greater than 0.25 (bad fit to coda amplitudes), the event weight is
incremented by 1.  Otherwise (good fit), the event weight remains the
same.  With default settings, this test by itself cannot cause an
event to be declared noise.
<PRE><!-- Default and example go here   -->
Default:  none				Calnet:  test_freefitrms 1

<A NAME="test_pgroup">  <!-- command name as anchor inside quotes -->
<PRE><B>test_pgroup <font color=red>switch</font>			eqverify_config		verification</B><!-- command args ... -->
</PRE>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <!-- command description goes here -->
Sets the switch for performing a test the temporal distribution of
P-arrivals for each event.  If <font color=red>switch</font> is non-zero, the test will be
performed; if <font color=red>switch</font> is zero, it will not be performed.  In this
test, all arrivals within "MaxDeltaT" seconds (default = 30) of the
first-arriving pick are examined to see if they belong to a glitch as
defined by default settings (at least 4 picks within 0.03 seconds) or
by the "define_glitch" command.  If 50% or more of all picks belong to
glitches, the event is declared noise.  If 30-50% of the picks are
glitch-picks, the event weight is incremented by 1.

Default:  none				Calnet:  test_pgroup 1

<A NAME="test_slopevsmag">  <!-- command name as anchor inside quotes -->
<PRE><B>test_slopevsmag <font color=red>switch</font>			eqverify_config		verification</B><!-- command args ... -->
</PRE>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <!-- command description goes here -->
Sets the switch for performing a test on the median slope (fit to the
coda window average absolute values) versus the magnitude calculated
from the median coda duration for each event.  If <font color=red>switch</font> is non-zero,
the test will be performed; if <font color=red>switch</font> is zero, it will not be
performed.  This test, taken from Lindh and Hirshorn's program eqmeas,
increments the event weight by the absolute value of the result of
this equation:
<PRE>   <font color=blue>median-slope</font> + 0.7*<font color=blue>magnitude-from-median-duration</font> + 0.5
</PRE>
For a normal earthquake, the slope fit to the coda windows should be
negative and the result from the above equation should be zero.  For
a noise event, the result from the above equation may be unbounded.
This test alone may cause an event to be declared noise.

<A NAME="notes">
<H2>4.  NOTES ON EQVERIFY'S DEFAULT VALUES FOR ITS CONSTANTS</H2>
<P>
For historical perspective, much of the verification source code was originally
written to work on Rex Allen RTP digitizer data which had an output range
of +/- 2500 counts for an input signal of +/- 2.5 Volts.  The Earthworm
system uses a 12-bit A/D; so its output ranges from +/- 2048 counts for the
same input signal of +/- 2.5 Volts.
<PRE>
   For Allen RTP digitizers,      1 mV = 1.0  counts
   For Earthworm digitizers,      1 mV = 0.82 counts
</PRE>
Many constants used here were originally defined for the RTP data to be
"nice round numbers" corresponding to some number of mV.  The defaults for
these constants have been converted for the Earthworm data; they still
correspond to the same mV values (they just aren't "nice round numbers"
any more).
