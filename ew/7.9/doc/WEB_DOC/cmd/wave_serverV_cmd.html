<!-- ADD HERE: Paragraph "On startup, xxxx reads the..." -->
On startup, wave_serverV reads the configuration file named on the command
line. Commands in this file set all the parameters used for configuring
the Earthworm wave_serverV module. In the control file, lines may begin with a
valid wave_serverV command (listed below) or with one of 2 special characters:

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
#  marks the line as a comment (example: # This is a comment).<BR>
@  allows control files to be nested; one control file can be
   accessed from another with the command "@" followed by
   a string representing the path name of the next control file
   (example: @model.d).
</BLOCKQUOTE></PRE>
Command names must be typed in the control file exactly as shown in this
document (upper/lower case matters!). Blank lines are also permitted in the
control file.

In the following section, all configuration file commands are listed
in alphabetical order.  Listed along with the command (bold-type) are
its arguments (in red), the name of the subroutine that processes the
command, and the function within the module that the command influences.
A detailed description of the command and is also given.  Default values

<PRE><B>AbortOnSingleTankFailure <font color=red>M</font>
</B><!-- command args ... -->
</PRE>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <!-- command description goes here -->
Set to 0 to have wave_server continue even
if there is a fatal error on a tank during normal processing.
If this flag is not set to 0, wave_server will die if any type of
IO error occurs on any tank.  If set to 1 wave_server will not exit
unless there is a server wide error. If not set, then the server will abort on any failure of a tank.

<A NAME="ClientTimeout">  <!-- command name as anchor inside quotes -->
<PRE><B>ClientTimeout <font color=red>M</font>
</B><!-- command args ... -->
</PRE>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <!-- command description goes here -->
Sets the timeout of <font color=red>M</font> milliseconds for response from
a client. If there are no idle server threads (set by
<A HREF="#MaxServerThreads">MaxServerThreads</A>), the server manager will
disconnect clients and kill server threads that have not heard anything from
their client in this period. Comment out or set to -1 if you don't want to
kill threads of silent clients.

</B><!-- command args ... -->
</PRE>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <!-- command description goes here -->
Sets the wave_serverV debug level to <font color=red>n</font>. Level zero gives
no debugging output; level one turns on debugging. Due to the large number of
transactions that a wave server typically handles, very large amounts of
debugging output may be produced.
<PRE><!-- Default and example go here   -->

<A NAME="GapThresh">  <!-- command name as anchor inside quotes -->
<PRE><B>GapThresh <font color=red>G</font>
</B><!-- command args ... -->
</PRE>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <!-- command description goes here -->
Sets the gap threshold to <font color=red>G</font> sample intervals. Trace data
packets are timestamped with a start time and a stop time, the times of the
first and last samples in that packet, respectively. Thus, the expected gap
between end time of one packet and the start time of the next packet is one
sample interval. Some data sources, such as older digitizers, produce data
with slightly larger or smaller intervals between them. The gap threshold is
intended to provide a means of detecting missing packets, without falsely
declaring a missing packet because of sloppy timestamps. The preferred value
for this gap threshold is 1.5. Set larger values only if you have a sloppy
data source. It is not clear how wave_serverV should handle intervals of much
more than one sample interval between packets if these are not caused by
missing packets.

</B><!-- command args ... -->
</PRE>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <!-- command description goes here -->
Defines the number of seconds, <font color=red>nsec</font> between
TYPE_HEARTBEAT messages issued by wave_serverV.
<PRE><!-- Default and example go here   -->
Default:  none

<A NAME="IndexUpdate">  <!-- command name as anchor inside quotes -->
<PRE><B>IndexUpdate <font color=red>U</font>
</B><!-- command args ... -->
</PRE>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <!-- command description goes here -->
Defines the interval in seconds <font color=red>U</font> between which
the index files are written to disk. Decreasing this number will keep the
index file closer to the conditions in the tank file, but will increase disk
activity. Each index file update involves opening the file, writing the new
index, and closing the file. If
<A HREF="#RedundantIndexFiles">RedundantIndexFiles</A> are being used, then the
update is alternated between the two index files for each tank.
<PRE><!-- Default and example go here   -->

<A NAME="InputQueueLen">  <!-- command name as anchor inside quotes -->
<PRE><B>InputQueueLen <font color=red>M</font>
</B><!-- command args ... -->
</PRE>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <!-- command description goes here -->
Sets the size of the input queue to <font color=red>M</font> messages.
Trace_buf messages are buffered in a queue when they are pulled off of an
earthworm message ring. They are removed from the queue when the main
thread is ready to process them.  Depending on the CPU and disk speed
of the machine you are using, this number should be about twice the
number of tanks you are trying to serve.  Slower machines may need
larger queues.
<PRE><!-- Default and example go here   -->
Default:  none
Example:  InputQueueLen 200

</B><!-- command args ... -->
</PRE>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <!-- command description goes here -->
Sets the on-off switch for writing a log file to disk. If
<font color=red>switch</font> is 0, no log file will be written. If
<font color=red>switch</font> is non-zero, wave_serverV will write daily log file(s)
called nnnnnxx.log_yyyymmdd where nnnnn is the name of the configuration file
(with the suffix `.d' removed), xx is wave_serverV's module id (set with
<A HREF="#MyModuleId">MyModuleId</A> command) and yyyymmdd is the current UTC
date (ex: 19960123) on the system clock. The file(s)
will be written in the EW_LOG directory (environment variable).
<PRE><!-- Default and example go here   -->
Default:  none

<HR>

<A NAME="MaxMsgSize">  <!-- command name as anchor inside quotes -->
<PRE><B>MaxMsgSize <font color=red>S</font>
</B><!-- command args ... -->
</PRE>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <!-- command description goes here -->
Optional command to set the maximum trace_buf2 message size to
 <font color=red>S</font> bytes. Normally, wave_serverV calculates the maximum
expected message size from the record size values given in
<A HREF="#Tank">Tank</A> commands. But if larger trace_buf2 messages are found
on wave_serverV's transport ring, such as SCNL's destined for a different
wave_serverV, their size must be set here. This is because wave_serverV must
allocate a buffer for examining each trace_buf2 message it finds on the
transport ring, and this command is the only way it knows how large to make
that buffer. If trace_buf2 messages are found with a larger size than given
here or in the Tank commands, wave_serverV will send an error message to
statmgr. If in doubt, you can set this command to 4096, the largest trace_buf2
message allowed in earthworm.
<PRE><!-- Default and example go here   -->
Default:  same as largest record size in Tank commands
Example:  MaxMsgSize 1064

<A NAME="MaxServerThreads">  <!-- command name as anchor inside quotes -->
<PRE><B>MaxServerThreads <font color=red>T</font>
</B><!-- command args ... -->
</PRE>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <!-- command description goes here -->
Sets the maximum number of server threads to <font color=red>T</font>.
One server thread is created for each client connected to the wave_serverV. The
more server threads you allow, the more load will be placed on
wave_serverV and the computer.
<PRE><!-- Default and example go here   -->

</B><!-- command args ... -->
</PRE>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <!-- command description goes here -->
Sets the module id for labeling all outgoing heartbeat and error
messages. <font color=red>mod_id</font> is a character string (valid strings
are listed in earthworm.d; maximum length is 29 characters) that relates to a
unique single-byte number. In
general, a different module ID is needed for each instance of wave_serverV.

<PRE><B>PacketSyncDbFile <font color=red>name</font>
</B><!-- command args ... -->
</PRE>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <!-- command description goes here -->
Defines the filename of the database to use for asynchronous packet buffering.
The argument <font color=red>name</font> may contain path information in addition
to the name of the file. This setting is only valid if
<A HREF="#UsePacketSyncDb">UsePacketSyncDb</A> is set to 1.

<A NAME="PleaseContinue">  <!-- command name as anchor inside quotes -->
<PRE><B>PleaseContinue <font color=red>X</font>
</B><!-- command args ... -->
</PRE>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <!-- command description goes here -->
Sets the PleaseContinue flag to <font color=red>X</font>. If this flag is zero
and wave_serverV has errors opening and reading its tank or index files,
wave_serverV will exit. If it is set to any non-zero value, wave_serverV will
continue after handling those tank file errors.

<A NAME="PurgePacketSyncDb">  <!-- command name as anchor inside quotes -->
<PRE><B>PurgePacketSyncDb <font color=red>U</font>
</B><!-- command args ... -->
</PRE>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <!-- command description goes here -->
Defines whether wave_serverV should purge all asynchronous trace buffer
packet data on startup. If the argument <font color=red>U</font> = 1 then the
packet data is deleted on startup. If it is 0 then packet data is not purged on
startup. Note that packet data is purged periodically during the operation of
wave_serverV if <A HREF="#UsePacketSyncDb">UsePacketSyncDb</A> is set to 1.
<PRE><!-- Default and example go here   -->
Default:  0

<A NAME="QueueReportInterval">  <!-- command name as anchor inside quotes -->
<PRE><B>QueueReportInterval <font color=red>R</font>
</B><!-- command args ... -->
</PRE>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <!-- command description goes here -->
Defines the number of seconds, <font color=red>R</font> between
queue reports. The queue report lists the high and low queue levels for the
previous interval. These reports show up in the log file and on standard
error output.
<PRE><!-- Default and example go here   -->

<A NAME="ReCreateBadTanks">  <!-- command name as anchor inside quotes -->
<PRE><B>ReCreateBadTanks <font color=red>X</font>
</B><!-- command args ... -->
</PRE>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <!-- command description goes here -->
Sets the ReCreateBadTanks flag to <font color=red>X</font>. If this flag is
set, then any tanks that were listed in the tank structure file and had
errors will be recreated using the parameters in the structure file.
Any tanks that were listed only in the config file and had errors will not
be constructed. See <A HREF="../ovr/wave_serverV_ovr.html#wsv_su">Wave Server Startup</A> in the overview file for more details. It is very unlikely
that setting this flag will help you. Usually it will "recreate bad tanks".
<PRE><!-- Default and example go here   -->
Default:  0 (bad tanks are not recreated)

<HR>

<A NAME="RedundantIndexFiles">  <!-- command name as anchor inside quotes -->
<PRE><B>RedundantIndexFiles <font color=red>X</font>
</B><!-- command args ... -->
</PRE>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <!-- command description goes here -->
Sets the RedundantIndexFiles flag to <font color=red>X</font>. If this flag is
set, then two index files will be created for each tank file. If not set,
then only one index file is created for each tank file. The index file names
are based on the tank file names with "-1.inx", and if two files, "-2.inx"
appended. Only a single index file is actually open for all the tanks at any
given instant. We recommend that you set this flag to 1.
<PRE><!-- Default and example go here   -->
Default:  0 (single index files for each tank)
Example:  RedundantIndexFiles 1
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>

<A NAME="RedundantTankStructFiles">  <!-- command name as anchor inside quotes -->
<PRE><B>RedundantTankStructFiles <font color=red>X</font>
</B><!-- command args ... -->
</PRE>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <!-- command description goes here -->
Sets the RedundantTankStructFiles flag to <font color=red>X</font>. If this
flag is set then two tank structure files will be used. If this flag is zero,
then only one tank structure file will be used. The first tank structure name
is given with the <A HREF="#TankStructFile">TankStructFile</A> command.
If two tank structure files are to be used, then you must also specify the
second structure file name with the
<A HREF="#TankStructFile2">TankStructFile2</A> command. Because of the
importance of the tank structure file for restarting wave_serverV, it is
strongly recommended that you use two tank structure files, by setting the
RedundantTankStructFiles flag.
<PRE><!-- Default and example go here   -->
Default:  0 (single tank structure file)

</PRE>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <!-- command description goes here -->
Tells wave_serverV which shared memory region to use for input and output.
<font color=red>ring</font> is a character string (valid strings are listed

</B><!-- command args ... -->
</PRE>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <!-- command description goes here -->
Defines the number of seconds, <font color=red>Q</font> between
error reports about the internal message queue. Normally when the message
queue gets full, an error message would be generated for each new trace_buf2
message that was supposed to go in the queue. This could be many messages per
second. To limit the number of error messages to a more reasonable frequency
this parameter should be set to the desired interval. The error messages
indicate the number of trace_buf2 messages that failed to enter the full queue
during the last reporting interval. If you get queue full
error messages very often, it means that wave_serverV, and probably your
computer, is not keeping up with its assigned load.

<A NAME="SocketTimeout">  <!-- command name as anchor inside quotes -->
<PRE><B>SocketTimeout <font color=red>m</font>

</PRE>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <!-- command description goes here -->
Sets the socket timeout interval to <font color=red>m</font> milliseconds.
This is for calls sending responses back to the client. Values should be a
few seconds, certainly less than one minute. If the timeout is exceeded, the
client is disconnected and the socket is closed.

<A NAME="Tank">  <!-- command name as anchor inside quotes -->
<PRE><B>Tank <font color=red>station channel net loc recsize inst_id mod_id tanksize indexsize tankfile-name</font>                             Required
</B><!-- command args ... -->
</PRE>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <!-- command description goes here -->
Specifies the parameters for one wave_serverV tank. This command is the heart
of wave_serverV configuration. Use one <B>Tank</B> for each tank to be
managed by this wave server, up to a maximum of 512 tanks. Computer systems
limit this to a smaller value: on Unix (Solaris), the limit is about 220,
based on the stdio limit of 256 open files. On WindowsNT, the limit is about
200.
 <P>
The wave trace data is selected for a Tank by the <font color=red>station</font>,
<font color=red>channel</font>, <font color=red>net</font>, and
<font color=red>loc</font> values (the
SCNL); these names must match exactly the names found in the trace data.
 <P>
The amount of space alloted for each wave trace (trace_buf2) packet in the
tank file is given by <font color=red>recsize</font>. This value, in bytes,
must be at least as large as the largest trace_buf2 packet expected for this
SCNL, and must be a multiple of 4. Trace_buf packets consist of a 64-byte
header, plus the trace data samples in binary format (either 2 or 4 bytes
per sample.) A handy tool for seeing the size of trace_buf2 packets is the
earthworm utility sniffwave. If trace_buf2 messages for this SCNL are found to
be larger than <font color=red>recsize</font>, they will be skipped and and
error message will be sent to statmgr.
 <P>
To further specify which trace_buf2 packets are read by wave_serverV, you can
set the <font color=red>inst_id</font> and <font color=red>mod_id</font> to
specific values (found in earthworm_global.d in the params directory.)
Trace_buf that have been produced at the earthworm installation with
<font color=red>net_id</font> and the module with <font color=red>mod_id</font>
will be selected; all others will not. Often it is more convenient to allow
trace data from any installation; in that case, <font color=red>inst_id</font>
would be set to <B>INST_WILDCARD.</B> Likewise for the moduleId, using
<B>MOD_WILDCARD.</B>
 <P>
The <font color=red>tanksize</font> parameter sets the size of the tank in
millions of bytes (ten to the sixth power, not 2 to the 20th power!). To
figure out how large to make your tank files, multiply these quantities
together: <font color=red>recsize</font>, number of trace packets per second
for this SCNL, and required duration of the tank in seconds. Be sure to allow
sufficient disk space for this and all the other tank files!
 <P>
The size of the index file (or files if
<A HREF="#RedundantIndexFiles">RedundantIndexFiles</A></A> is set to 1) is
specified as <font color=red>indexsize</font> entries. Each index entry is
about 20 bytes, not large. Each index entry records the start time, tank
file location (offset) and endtime of a "chunk" of trace data. A new "chunk"
of trace data is started whenever there is a gap larger than
<A HREF="#GapThresh">GapThresh</A> sample intervals between the end time of
one trace_buf2 packet and the start of the next one in the tank. So if you
have lots of gaps in trace data for one SCNL (due to telemetry problems, for
example) be sure to make the index files large enough. If wave_serverV runs
out of index entry for an tank, it will send an error message to statmgr. Then
it will overwrite the oldest index entry with new information. The result will
be that the trace_data referenced by that just erased index entry will no
longer be accessible from the tank file.
 <P>
If you find that you need to increase the size of your index files, you can
do so by changing <font color=red>indexsize</font> and restarting wave_serverV.
Do not remove the old index files; they will be extended with new, blank
entries for later use.
 <P>
If you have valuable old data in a tank file that has become inaccessible
because of index file problems, it is possible to reconstruct the index file,
using either wave_serverV or the utility <B>inspect_tank</B>. If you need
assistance with this, ask for help from the earthworm mailing list or
Earthworm Central. Naturally, your need will likely come in the heat of battle,
so don't panic and delete files that might be useful.
 <P>
The last parameter in the Tank command is the
<font color=red>tankfile-name</font>; this gives the full pathname for the tank
file. We recommend that you make the tank name similar to the SCNL to aid in
file manipulation.

This should be a full pathname, not a simple file name. This structure file
name traditionally ends in "-1.str", but this is not required.
The tank structure file
contains configuration parameters for all existing tank files. It also contains
the location in the tank file where new trace data is to be added. This

Defines the number of seconds, <font color=red>U</font> between
tank structure file updates. The TANK structure is maintained in memory, and
periodically written to disk.  The TANK structure tracks the status of the
all the tank files.  Any data written to the tanks since the last time the
TANK structure was written to disk is effectively lost if wave_serverV crashes.
The larger the interval, the more tank data is potentially lost in a crash;
the smaller the update interval the more disk I/O that is required for
wave_server to operate. We recommend a structure file update interval of
one second.

#           Other Optional Commands


#MaxMsgSize: Optional command to tell wave_server about TRACEBUF2 messages
# that could be larger than any going to tanks for this server. This
# may happen if you have two wave_servers and TRACEBUF2 sources that
# produce different size messages, e.g., ref2ew messages are 1064 bytes.
MaxMsgSize 1064

#Debug  Generates VERYVERYVERY large log files.
#Debug 1

#SocketDebug Set to 1 to get SOCKET_ew debug statements
SocketDebug 0

#PleaseContinue  Set to 1 to have wave_server continue, even if
#  there are errors during initialization
# PleaseContinue 1

#ReCreateBadTanks Set to 1 to have bad tanks re-created from scratch.
#ReCreateBadTanks 1

#SecondsBetweenQueueErrorReports   Minimum period of time between error
#  reports to statmgr due to the internal message queue being lapped,
#  and thus messages being lost.  Default is 60 seconds
#SecondsBetweenQueueErrorReports 30

#MaxServerThreads  Maximum of server threads to deploy to handle client
#  requests.  Default is 10.
#MaxServerThreads 10

#QueueReportInterval  The minimum number of seconds between
#  reports on internal queue high and low water marks.  The default is 30.
#QueueReportInterval 5

#AbortOnSingleTankFailure  Set to 0 to have wave_server continue even
#if there is a fatal error on a tank during normal processing.
#if this flag is not set to 0, wave_server will die if any type of
#IO error occurs on any tank.  If set to 1, wave_server will not exit
#unless there is a server wide error.
#AbortOnSingleTankFailure 1

#UsePacketSyncDb Uncomment entry and set to 1 to use embedded db functionality
# to manage asychronous trace buffer packets. Currently this is either on or off
# for all SNCLs.
#UsePacketSyncDb 1

#PacketSyncDbFile - Specifies name of database file to use. If not specified
# and UsePacketSyncDb == 1 then the default PCKTSYNC.SL3DB is used.
#PacketSyncDbFile "TB2PACKETS.SL3DB"

#PurgePacketSyncD Uncomment and specify one of the following to control
# how long out of sync data is kept in the database if UsePacketSyncDb=1.
# 1 : Purge data on startup
# 0 : Do not purge data on startup. Obsolete data is intermittently purged
# during the operation of wave_serverV is UsePacketSyncDb is 1.
