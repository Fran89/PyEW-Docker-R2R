<!-- Paragraph "On startup, xxxx reads the..." -->
On startup, eqprelim reads the configuration file named on the command-line.
Commands in this file set up all parameters used in making preliminary
earthquake notifications. In the control file, lines may begin with a
valid eqprelim command (listed below) or with one of 2 special characters:

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
#  marks the line as a comment (example: # This is a comment).<BR>
@  allows control files to be nested; one control file can be
   accessed from another with the command "@" followed by
   a string representing the path name of the next control file
   (example: @model.d).
</BLOCKQUOTE></PRE>
Command names must be typed in the control file exactly as shown in this
document (upper/lower case matters!).

In the following section, all configuration file commands are listed
in alphabetical order.  Listed along with the command (bold-type) are
its arguments (in red), the name of the subroutine that processes the
command, and the function within the module that the command influences.
A detailed description of the command and is also given.  Default values

write a daily log file(s) called eqprelimxx.log_yymmdd where xx is
eqprelim's module id (set with "MyModuleId" command) and yymmdd is the
current UTC date (ex: 960123) on the system clock.  The file(s) will

Sets the threshold for initiating preliminary event processing.
When an event has at least <font color=red>npck</font> P-arrivals associated with it,
eqprelim will pipe that event to the process specified in the "PipeTo"
command.  Eqprelim will initiate only one preliminary location per
binder eventid, so <font color=red>npck</font> should be set at the number of phases
where most event locations become stable (where additional picks
won't change the location).<BR>

Enters site codes and station locations into the site table by reading
a HYPOINVERSE format station file called <font color=red>filename</font>.  In this file,
stations are described by a 5-letter site name, a 2-letter network
code and a 3-letter component code.  The picker must also be using
this station-naming convention.  The format of the file is described
under <A HREF="../USER_GUIDE/hypoinv_sta.html">"HYPOINVERSE STATION FILE FOR FULL 12-LETTER (S-N-C-L) CHANNEL NAMES"</A>.  Use either one "site_file" command or

<H2>4.  THE "MEGA-MODULE" WHICH BEGINS WITH EQPRELIM</H2>
<P>
The eqprelim "mega-module" is a chain of processes that produces
preliminary earthquake locations for the Earthworm system.   Only eqprelim, the first link in the mega-module, is listed
in startstop's configuration file to be started by startstop.  Eqprelim
then starts the next process, specified in its "PipeTo" command, and
communicates with it via a pipe.
Each newly created process starts the next link in the same way.
From startstop's point of view, the whole mega-module inherits the name
of the first link (eqprelim) and that's the only name it displays.
From statmgr's point of view, all processes
within the mega-module share one module id, one heartbeat, and one
descriptor file.  However, each process has its own configuration file
and its own log file.
<P>
As of 10 October, 1996, the eqprelim mega-module consists of
the following "links":
<PRE>
  SUB-MODULE    INPUT FROM   		  	OUTPUT TO
  ----------	----------		  	---------
  eqprelim 	shared memory (PICK_RING)	pipe to eqbuf
  eqbuf   	stdin (pipe from eqprelim)   	pipe to eqcoda
  eqcoda	stdin (pipe from eqbuf)    	pipe to eqverify
  eqverify	stdin (pipe from eqcoda)   	pipe to hypo_mgr
  hypo_mgr	stdin (pipe from eqverify)	shared memory (HYPO_RING)

</PRE>

<H3>Inter-link (Intra-mega-module) Communication:</H3>
All messages are passed between the processes of the mega-module
via pipes.  The pipe communications are encapsulated in a set of routines containing
the peculiarities of the operating system.  Messages, with types defined
in earthworm.d, are sent from one link to the next, in one direction only!
If a process
doesn't need to do anything with a given message type, it just pipes it
along to the next link.  The current pipe routines (in pipe.c) are:
<PRE>
  pipe_init   	starts up the next "link", replacing its stdin with
		a pipe from the "parent" program.
  pipe_put	writes a message of a given type to the pipe.
  pipe_get	gets the next message from the pipe.
  pipe_close    closes the pipe.

</PRE>

<H3>Heartbeats:</H3>
The mega-module has one module-id and one heartbeat.  The heartbeat
initiates at the first link (eqprelim), is piped through all the links, and is
deposited into shared memory by the last link (in this case, hypo_mgr).
If any of the links dies,
no heartbeat will be seen by statmgr and it will complain appropriately.

<H3>Error Messages:</H3>
Since the whole mega-module has only one module-id, the sub-modules need
to share the complete set of error numbers within a common descriptor file.
Each link is assigned a
block of error numbers to use for its complaints.  Each link passes along
any error messages it reads from the pipe.  The last link puts all error
messages into shared memory where they are available to statmgr.
Statmgr reads one descriptor file for the mega-module.

<H3>Final Output from Mega-module:</H3>
The last link in the mega-module, hypo_mgr, deposits heartbeats, error
messages, and event messages
(that look like hypoinverse archive files) onto shared memory where any
other Earthworm module can find them.
