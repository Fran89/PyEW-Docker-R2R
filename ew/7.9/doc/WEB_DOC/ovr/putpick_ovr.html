    Putpick Overview</h1>
  <i>(last revised 1 June, 2006)</i>

<p>Program to read a file containing a series of pick/coda msgs and write them
  to shared memory. The file can contain a mix of <tt>TYPE_PICK2K, TYPE_PICK_SCNL,
  TYPE_CODA2K, TYPE_CODA_SCNL</tt>, and also comments. Only valid <tt>TYPE_PICK</tt>
  and <tt>TYPE_CODA</tt> msgs will be written to shared memory; all other lines
  will be ignored. </p>
<p>Putpick is useful for replaying picks into binder - binder's logfile (or a
  portion of it) can be used as the input file to putpick, or the picks can be
  placed in a seperate file. </p>
<p>If pause = y, the relative timing of writing msgs to ring is based on delta-t
  in the timestamps in the picks. </p>
<p>If pause = n, the msgs are written to the ring as fast as they are read from
  the file. </p>
<pickfile> <RING_NAME> <pause: y/n>
  <br>
<code>Usage: putpick &lt;pickfile&gt; &lt;RING_NAME&gt; &lt;pause: y/n&gt;</code>
