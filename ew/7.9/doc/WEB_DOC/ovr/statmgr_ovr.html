<P>Statmgr is tool to monitor the health of all the Earthworm modules. It reports
  on the health by email, and it may automatically issue a restart request for
  a dead module, if the module's .desc file configures statmgr to do so.
<P>Statmgr works by monitoring error messages which are produced by other Earthworm
  modules, and determines whether to report and how to report an error. Errors
  are reported by sending email or generating TYPE_PAGE messages. User-provided
  software can then pick up the TYPE_PAGE message and hand it to paging software
  to transmits these messages via modem to a pager service. Statmgr also monitors
  heartbeats of client modules, and if heartbeats are not received, an email and/or
  pager message is produced.
<P> Statmgr has a restart feature which allows the system to recover if any module
  hangs by restarting only the hung module. Any module can request to be restarted
  if it's heartbeat stops. Otherwise, no restart attempt will be made. If statmgr
  detects that heartbeats from the module have stopped, statmgr will send a message
  of type TYPE_RESTART to the startstop program. Startstop will then kill the
  module process and restart the module.
<P>Statmgr monitors for TYPE_STOP messages. If it sees one, it will not attempt
  to restart the stopped module, assuming it's been intentionally stopped with
  the &quot;stopmodule&quot; commandline utility, or the &quot;stopmodule&quot;
  command in startstop. It also monitors for TYPE_RESTART messages. If it sees
  a restart of a stopped module, it'll assume that it's been started again, and
  will resume monitoring of it.
<P>By default, Statmgr only monitors for heartbeat messages the RingName specified
  in the statmgr.d config file. Typically modules only send heartbeat messages
  to the ring they're active on. Thus if one wants to have statmgr monitor modules
  which aren't on the ring that RingName specifies, one needs to do one of two
  things. The first option is to set CheckAllRings to 1 in statmgr.d. Statmgr
  will make a status request to startstop when it starts up and monitor all the
  rings that startstop knows about. This works fine on many systems, but some
  systems with large amounts of information moving through a single ring may overload
  statmgr's ability to keep up. The second option is to set up a 'copystatus'
  module to copy the status from every ring with an active module, the the ring
  specified by RingName which statmgr is monitoring. It clutters up your status
  screen a bit, but does the job.
<P>
For each module monitored by statmgr, a descriptor file must exist and be specified in the statmgr configuration file.  The earthworm convention has been to use the suffix '.desc' to indicate a descriptor file.  In the descriptor file, the user may specify the following:
<ul>
	<li>How often the statmgr should check for the modules heartbeat and if email and/or pagers messages should be sent in case of missing heartbeats.
	<li>Who should pager messages (pagegroup command overrides same command in statmgr configuration file).
	<li>For each error reported by a module, should email and/or pagers messages be sent and how often should the messages be sent.
