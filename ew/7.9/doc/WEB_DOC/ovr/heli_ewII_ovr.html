<P>
History:
<P>
<STRONG>heli_ewII</STRONG> creates Helicorder displays of waveforms for the WWW.  Jim Luetgert created the original heli1 10/7/98. He did all the hard work.
        Pete Lombard then did extensive cleaning and debugging. This effort resulted in two
        versions: heli_standalone, which was a free-standing program (although
        using earthworm functions), and heli_ew, which ran as a Module, thus providing
        error processing and restarts.
<P>
                Meanwhile, Jim Luetgert and others proceeded to develop and enhance similar
        programs. We're aware of six such efforts. What to do. Given Pete's efforts
        to stabilize heli_standalone, and its proven track-record for reliability, and
        that we're to provide a mission-critical system, as well as a community effort,
        we're producing heli_ewII as the staid, reliable, supported product. It is a combination
        of heli_ew and heli_standalone.
<P>
                We will carry fancier products as contributed to us by others in the
        earthworm/Contrib section. From time to time, we may adopt and adapt some
        of these more advanced products into the core earthworm software.
<P>
Features:
<OL>
<LI>
Runs on NT and Solaris.
</LI>
Runs as a module: Specifying earthworm parameters in its
           configuration file will cause it to become a module. It will attach to
           the specified ring, produce heartbeats, and use earthworm logging. It can
           be restarted if it asserts 'restartMe' in its .desc file.
<LI>
Runs as a standalone program: If no Earthworm paramters are given in the
           .d file, it will run standalone. Errors will be written to stderr.
<LI>
Does not try to move files to another machine. This was removed in the name
           of security and modularity. Moving the image files to a separate server machine
           is a reasonable option, but should be done by another facility. Shared disks via
           operating system features or SendFile are two options.






<P>
heli_ewII is designed to rapidly provide GIF images of waveforms for display on the WWW.  heli_ewII periodically retrieves  data for a selected list of stations and updates GIF images which are transferred to webserver(s).  The required waveforms are obtained via requests to Earthworm waveserver(s) and plotted directly to GIF format image files.  When all of the required GIF files have been constructed, .html wrappers are built.
<P>
The default structure for the webserver consists of an index.html page listing the stations and dates available for viewing.  The dates are each a hotlink to an .html wrapper for each station/date helicorder GIF.
<P>
How to set it up:
<P>
The first task is to set up a directory for the GIF images
and .html files.
<P>
Now comes the fun part; setting up the configuration files.

#
# This is the heli_ewII parameter file. This module gets data gulps
# from the waveserver(s), and creates helicorder displays.
# This program runs either standalone or as an Earthworm module.
# If any of the four Earthworm paramaters below are stated, it will asssume
# that it's supposed to be a module. It will beat it's heart into the ring,
# and use the Earthworm logging scheme. Other wise, it runs standalone.


#  Basic Earthworm setup:
#
LogSwitch    1              # 0 to completely turn off disk log file
MyModuleId   MOD_HELI       # module id for this instance of report
RingName     HYPO_RING      # ring to get input from
HeartBeatInt 15             # seconds between heartbeats

wsTimeout 12 	# time limit (secs) for any one interaction with a wave server.

>>>>
>>>> We need to know a reasonable time limit for getting

# List of wave servers (ip port comment) to contact to retrieve trace data.

 WaveServer www.xxx.yyy.zzz    16024      "wsv2 - ad3"

# Plot Parameters - sorry it's so complex, but that's the price of versatility

# 12 Minutes/Line    Number of minutes per line of trace

# 13 Gain Factor     Instrument gain in microvolt/bit.

# 14 Scale Factor    Scale factor to dress up image.

# 15 Mean Removal    Mean of 1st minute of each line will be removed.

<P>
Customizing the .html wrapper:
<P>
The .html wrapper for the primary web page has provision for customization to
reflect the identity and flavor of an individual earthworm site.  If you do nothing, a generic wrapper is constructed.  You may control, however, the top part of the index page and the bottom of the index page by placing the .html code you want in files named indexa.html and indexb.html respectively in the GIFs/helicorder/ directory.  The module will attempt to open and read indexa.html for the top of the page; if it can't find the file, it generates a generic beginning for the index.html file.  It then pastes in links to the helicorder GIF images.  Finally, it looks for indexb.html to finish off the page.  If there is no indexb.html, it provides a generic ending.
