<P>
Eqbuf is a sub-module in Earthworm's event-processing mega-module.
It is generally the second link in the mega-module and is started by the
first link (either eqproc or eqprelim). Eqbuf in turn starts up the third
link (generally eqcoda) and communicates to it via a one-directional pipe.
Once the third link is started, eqbuf's job is simply to buffer all the
messages output by the process that started it. This allows the "head" module
to produce events as fast as it cares to while allowing the "tail" of the
mega-module to take its time finishing the event-processing. Eqbuf never
looks inside a message, it just passes them thru as they are.
