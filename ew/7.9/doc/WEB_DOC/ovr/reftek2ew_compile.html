In order to build this program, you need to define the following in
your earthworm.d file:

RAW_RING       - transport ring for raw packets from the RTP server
MOD_IMPORT_RTP - module id for this process
TYPE_REFTEK    - message type for raw RTP server packets

If you want to assign pin numbers, you will need to define them in a
parameter file.  See import_rtp.d for the specification syntax, and
see reftek.scn for an example.

All dialog with the RTP server is done via the Refraction Technology
API and libraries.  You can get a copy of this toolkit from

                    ftp://ftp.reftek.com:/pub/rtp

Install the libraries and include files as per the instructions provided
with the toolkit.  You will need to specify the installation location in
your makefile.  See the comments in the makefile appropriate for your
system.
