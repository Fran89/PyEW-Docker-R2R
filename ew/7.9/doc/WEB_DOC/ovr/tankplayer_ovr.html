<h1>Tankplayer Overview</h1>
<i>(last revised September 9, 2008)</i></center>
<p>
"tankplayer" is part of the four-program set for recording and playing
back the trace data for selected time intervals. See also <a
 href="trig2disk_ovr.html">trig2disk</a>, <a
 href="waveman2disk_ovr.html">waveman2disk</a>, and <a
 href="wave_serverV_ovr.html">wave_serverV</a>. </p>
<p>Tankplayer has two common uses and one new use:
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tuning Operating Earthworms:</span>
</p>
<p>For example, an Earthworm system fails to locate a significant
earthquake. The waveform data for the earthquake is requested from the
wave_server and saved in tankplayer format. Using an experimental
Earthworm, the event is played back with tankplayer, tuning the
operational parameters until Earthworm performs satisfactorally. The
operational parameters are then changed to those used in the test.
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Quality Assurance:</span>
</p>
<p>One is to perform quality assurance tests. For such tests, an
experimental Earthworm system would be set up, and one or more
tankplayers would be connected as the data source. Each tankplayer
would be given a lengthy list of data files, and "tankplayer" would
play (broadcast into the earthworm) the trace data from these files,
one after another, generally overnight. The earthworm system under test
would then process the incoming data. In the morning, we would come in
and examine the rubble. </p>
<p> Menlo Park has created a collection of over 50 historic trace data
files, representing the trace data traffic during various 'moments of
horror' at CalNet. These include the Loma Prieta mainshock, swarms
during wind storms, concurrent events in different parts of the net,
events during telemetry malfunctions, etc. These files were painfully
created by reformatting CUSP data archive files. The format of these
files is simple: it is a series of messages of TYPE_ADBUF, written with
a binary write.<br>
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Real Time Data Feed:</span><br>
</p>
<p>Alternatively, as of Earthworm 7.3, the tankplayer module now
accepts tank files moved into a loading directory for automatic
playback. This is configured using the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">GetFromDir</span> setting in the .d file.
The files must be loaded in time order for this mode to work. This
provides the Earthworm user with a new way to load waveforms into the
rings...by creating a tank file generating program.<br>
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">How Tankplayer Works:</span>
</p>
<p>On startup, tankplayer reads its configuration file. This specifies
the message ring into which to inject the data, and the module name to
use. Tankplayer is generally told to imitate a real data source, such
as an A/D module, or a digital acquisition module. The parameter file
also lists the data files to be played back. It also specifies a pause
period. This was implemented to prevent the earthworm associator
(binder) from becoming confused by rapid jumps in time between data
files. This time period should be set to be larger than binder's
association memory, to prevent it from trying to associate phase
arrivals from different data files.
</p>
<p>In operation, tankplayer places the waveform messages from its input
file(S) into shared memory in simulated real time, using the delta-t
between time-stamps in successive message headers to determine its
timing. When the end of file is reached, it waits "Pause" number of
seconds, and goes on to the next file, as specified in the parameter
file.
</p>
<p>
Tankplayer is location code compliant and backward compatible. It
accepts
messages of either tracebuf or tracebuf2 as configured using the
PlayMsgType
parameter.

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="tankplayer_tools"></a>Tankplayer
Tools:</span>
</p>
<p>Separate from tankplayer are tools to help create tankfiles from sac
format
files. One can also
archive tank files using <a href="waveman2disk_ovr.html">waveman2disk</a>
and configuring appropriate output format. The two tools are <i>sac2tb</i>
and <i>remux_tbuf</i>. The notes from Pete Lombard about these tools:
</p>
<blockquote>This is sac2tb, a utility for turning SAC data files into
tracebuf files.
Usage: sac2tb [-n samples] sacfile &gt; tbuf-file
  <p>Without the -n option, sac2tb defaults to 100 samples per packet. </p>
  <p>The intended use is that you run sac2tb on a bunch of SAC files
for a given
event or time period, "cat" all the files together, and then run
remux_tbuf
to make a tankplayer file. For example, in a directory of SAC files: </p>
  <pre>  foreach m (*)<br>  sac2tb $m &gt;&gt; tbuf<br>  end<br><br>  remux_tbuf tbuf test.tnk<br></pre>
  <p>SAC doesn't have a provision for byte-swapping, so to my
knowledge, SAC
files
are only in SPARC byte-order. At least that's the assumption here. If
sac2tb
is run on an intel machine, the SAC file will be swapped into intel
byte-order
and the resulting tracebuf messages will be marked accordingly. </p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">Five New Tankplayer tools for EW v7.2:</p>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">ms2tank</span> - convert
miniseed files into a tank player buffer. This
version uses Chad Trabant's libmseed which is now a part of the stock
earthworm distribution. The previous version, ms2tb, used the UCB qlib2
and was restricted to Solaris and Linux. This version works on Solaris,
Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X.<br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">tanksniff</span> - this module
outputs a sniffwave like output when you
pass it a tank. It allows you to look at the contents of your tanks
without having to play them back in tankplayer. It takes one argument,
a tank.<br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">tankcut</span> - this module
will extract out a specified time slice
from a tank. It requires a starting time and duration for extraction.
If you run the module without any arguments, it spits back the version
number and the argument options/args:</li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;">
<pre>$ tankcut</pre>
<pre>Error, an input and output tank name must be provided<br>tankcut version v0.0.1 2007-08-27<br>usage: tankcut -s StartTime [-e EndTime|-d Duration] intank outtank<br>		all times for -s and -e options must be in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format</pre>
<pre>        -s StartTime - when to start including tracebufs from intank<br>	-e EndTime - when to end including tracebufs from intank<br>        -d Duration - Duration in seconds from start time when to end including tracebufs from intank<br>		Default Duration is 600 seconds from start time</pre>
</div>
<pre><br></pre>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">ring2tank</span> - have you ever
wanted to suck the data out of your
ring and play it back to simulate a few hours of running of your
system....well now you can. This module does just what it says, it
takes 2 arguments, the name of a RING to read from, and the name of a
tankfile to write to. Be warned that this module has no real smarts and
will just keep on filling a file till it grows infinitely. You must
CAREFULLY run this module from the command line and kill it when you
are done with your data gathering...or it may kill your system when the
disk fills. On SOLARIS systems the disk size limit for a file is 2
gigabytes unless you compile the program with the LARGEFILE flag
options. See tankcut above when you want to trim the tank generated
from this module.<br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">dc2tank</span> - Data Center to
tank. This is a complex module that
allows a user to gather some data from the IRIS DMC using the
DHI2mseed.jar java program. It extracts the desired stations and builds
a tank based on an event start time and duration. There is a <a
 href="README.dc2tank">README.dc2tank</a> provided with the code. This
module requires that you have java installed on your system and in your
path.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
