<h1>Earthworm Program: <br>
Waveman2disk Overview</h1>
<i>(last revised Jan 11, 2010)</i></center>
<p>
<strong>waveman2disk</strong> is a manual, interactive version
of trig2disk. Its purpose is to save trace data to disk in variuos
supported formats - currently ah_xdr, sac, pc-suds, seisan, gse, wfdisc, and
tankplayer.
Like any good
earthworm program, it has a configuration file waveman2disk.d allowing
for extensive configuration. This is where we tell it, among other
things, which waveservers to interrogate, where and it which format to
store the trace output,
</p>
<p> waveman2disk works in two modes:
</p>
<pre>(1) Interactive:  the config file lists the output format <br>      and directory, as well as the channels to save. The user is prompted <br>      for the start and end time of trace data to be saved.<br><br>(2) Trigger-saving: a file, specified in the config file, contains<br>      ascii text of one or more TYPE_TRIGLIST2K messages. These are processed<br>      one at a time, and the trace data of the channels listed in the<br>      TRIGLIST2K message, are saved to disk.<br></pre>
<p>
Note on output formats:
</p>
<p>The trig2disk module has been extensively re-packaged to allow
for easier addition and modification of output formats. Basically,
all functionality dealing with producing output on disk has been moved
into libsrc/util. The putaway.c file contains entry points
into the trace writing system. This is where any new output format
should be added. Associated with it are files like sacputaway.c,
sudsputaway.c and ahputaway.c that actually implement the writing
of various output formats to disk.<br>
</p>
<p>PSN4 format was added for windows in Earthworm 7.1 (contact <a
 href="http://www.webtronics.com/">www.webtronics.com</a> for details).<br>
</p>
<p>MSEED format was added for solaris in Earthworm 7.1.<br>
</p>
</p>
<p>WFDISC format was added for Linux in Earthworm 7.4.<br>
wfdisc format can take advantage of a wfdisc params config file which must be
located at "EW_PARAMS/wfdisc_waveman.d" where EW_PARAMS is the EW_PARAMS env
variable.  The content of this file is very specific and allows one to specify
station/channel specific information on chanid, calib, calper, instype and
segtype, as well alternative locations for .w datafiles and wfdisc consolidation rules.  See the command document for file syntax and formatting<br>
