<I>(last revised 2 March, 2010)</I></CENTER>
<P>
The ewintegrate module performs any non-empty subset of 3 stages of processing
wave data (TYPE_TRACEBUF2) coming from the InRing defined in
ewintegrate.d. Processed trace messages are written to the OutRing with their
SCNs changed as specified in ewintegrate.d.
<P>
The three stages are:
<UL>
<li>Debiasing, as is done in the <A HREF="debias_ovr.html">debias</A> module</li>.
It is a rolling-average filter whose window size (in seconds) is
specified in ewintegrate.d; if no window size is specified, this stage passes its
input unchanged to the next.
<li>Integration.  If DoIntegration is not specified in ewintegrate.d, the result
of the previous stage is passed unchanged to the next</li>
<LI>High-pass filtering, which requires both the order and frequency cutoff to be
specified; if neither is, the result of the previous stage is passed unchanged
to the next.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
As in the <A HREF="debias_ovr.html">debias</A> module, the debias stage may
cause some time delay at the beginning of each span of contiguous
records, as it needs to fill the window to begin computing the averages used
to debias the data; once the window is full, it can catch up and continue with
little delay.
