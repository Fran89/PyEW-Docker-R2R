INSTALLING AND CONFIGURING REFTEK DATA LOGGERS, CISCO ROUTERS, 
AND RTPD SERVERS

    Lucky Vidmar Fri Jan 29 11:49:21 MST 1999



This file contains instructions for configuring RefTek data loggers
(e.g. model 72A with serial card RT422) to deliver data into a Solaris
or NT machine and convert it into Earthworm packets. The instructions
contained here are the result of trial-and-error, complemented with a
hefty dose of tech support from RefTek. Consulting ALL of the available
RefTek documentation is strongly recommended.

Communication between a RefTek data logger (Data Acquisition System -
DAS) and the server machine is done via the RefTek Protocol (RTP).  RTP
is designed to provide full-duplex, packet-oriented transport over UDP.
RTP is implemented as a client-server process with a DAS with a RT422
serial card as the client, and the RTPD application as the server. RTPD
is available for NT and Solaris - see instructions below for installing
RPTD on each platform.

RefTek recommends that RTP is implemented through a router, for example
a Cisco 2509, such that the set up will consist of two class C networks
(one on each side of the router).  The client DAS is on one network and
will connect to the router through an asynch serial interface using
PPP. The server is on the other network and the router takes care of
routing the traffic between the two networks.

CONFIGURING RTPD SERVER

More information about installing and troubleshooting RTPD can be
found in the RTPD Installation and Users Guide Manual.

1.  Windows NT 4.0

To configure the RTPD server as a Windows NT 4.0 service, copy the
service executable rtpudpsvc.exe and the startup file rtpd.ini from the
utils/winnt directory to, for example, c:\reftek. Edit the rtpd.ini
file to reflect local customizations (for example, directory names,
etc) then execute the following commands to install this program as a
service:

 c:
 cd \reftek
 svcins rptd_service "RefTek Data Server" c:\reftek\rtpudpsvc.exe

The RTPD service can now be controlled like any other NT service,
using the Services icon within the Control Panel.


2.  Solaris 2.6

o Copy the rtpd binary from the utils/solaris directory to whatever
  directory you find convenient, and make sure it is setuid as the user
  you want it to run as.

This example assumes user "root", with executables in /usr/local/bin.
In that case you would copy rtpd to /usr/local/bin and execute the
following commands:

   chown root /usr/local/bin/rtpd
   chmod 4555 /usr/local/bin/rtpd


o Copy the rtpd.ini file from solaris/winnt to, for example,
  /usr/local/etc directory and make any local customizations to it.

The Solaris version of the file is identical to the NT version, with
the exception that path names are different.  You also have the choice
of using the syslog logging facility.  Suppose you want to use syslog.
Then select a facility and give it in the ini file like:

Facility   LOCAL6

Then, edit /etc/syslog.conf and include the following line:

local6.debug	/var/log/local6

Note that it should be a TAB between the two tokens.  Create
/var/log/local6 and HUP syslogd (as root, kill -HUP <syslogd pid>),
once to get it to reread the conf file.  See syslog.conf(4) and
syslogd(1M) for additional information.


o Copy the startup script utils/solaris/rtpd_init to /etc/init.d 
  and make sure that it is executable (mode 544) and owned by root. 
  Change directory names and make any other local customizations. 

  Make the following soft links::

# ln -s /etc/init.d/rtpd_init /etc/rc3.d/S75rtpd_init
# ln -s /etc/init.d/rtpd_init /etc/rc2.d/K10rtpd_init
# ln -s /etc/init.d/rtpd_init /etc/rc0.d/K10rtpd_init

This will cause RTPD to be started automatically at boot time, and to
go down gracefully at system shutdown.  

The following command will manually stop the RTPD server:

reftek% /etc/init.d/rtpd_init stop

The following command will manually start the RTPD server:

reftek% /etc/init.d/rtpd_init start
