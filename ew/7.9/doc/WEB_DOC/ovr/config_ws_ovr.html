<P>
The <strong>config_ws</strong> program
listens to a WAVE_RING for TRACEBUF or TRACEBUF2 messages  and writes the necessary tank files format
for WaveServerV. This is useful if you have to sniff a ring and archive all of the trace's from that
ring, but you don't know exactly what SCN/SCNL's are on it.
