<P>
The debias module implements a rolling-average filter routine to
process wave data (TYPE_TRACEBUF2) coming from the InRing defined in
debias.d. Debiased trace messages are written to the OutRing with their
SCNs changed as specified in debias.d. The debiased trace message retains
its TYPE_TRACEBUF2 type, but it has a new SCNL name. The size of the window
used to compute the average is specified in seconds in debias.d.
<P>
Debias may cause some time delay at the beginning of each span of contiguous
records, as it needs to fill the window to begin computing the averages used
to debias the data; once the window is full, it can catch up and continue with
little delay.
