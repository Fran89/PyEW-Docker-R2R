<h1> Import-Export Overview</h1>
  <i>(last revised 9 April 2010)<br>
</i></center>
<p>Newly created for EW v7.0 is <a href="#export_ack">export_ack</a>, <a
 href="#export_ack">export_scnl_ack</a>, and <a href="#import_ack">import_ack</a>
for acknowledgement handshaking.</p>
<p>The modules import_generic, export_generic, and export_scn represent
the Earthworm long-distance communication modules that provide a rapid,
secure message exchange facility between two or more Earthworm or other
processing systems. Any link capable of supporting the TCP/IP protocol
suite can be used. The philosophy underlying these modules is that they
implement a static, long-term linkage between pairs of cooperating
installations. It is presumed that this linkage has been agreed upon by
both institutions, and that both installations establish matching
configurations that provide reasonably good assurance that only the
designated machines are participating in the linkage. </p>
<p>Export_generic accepts a list of message logos (installation id,
module id, and message type) to export. Any messages with matching
logos will be queued in a memory based FIFO, and sent to the receiving
"import_generic", or similar program, via a TCP connection. If the
available bandwidth of the link is lower than the aggregate rate of
messages being queued for shipping, the FIFO will eventually overflow.
In that case, an error is logged, and the queue becomes circular. That
is, if the queue is configured to be N messages long, it will contain
the most recent N messages. The intent is to avoid shipping uselessly
old messages such as when two systems exchange phase picks or trace
data for 'real-time' event detection.
</p>
<p> Import_generic receives such messages, and releases them into its
local system under the logos with which they were sent. Other modules
in that Earthworm may then selectively examine or ignore such messages
by specifying which installation id's they are interested in.
</p>
<p>Both import_generic and export_generic offer 'stub' routines through
which all messages pass. The intent is to provide an easy place to
insert custom code to process messages before they are sent out (in
export_generic), and after they are received, but before they are
released into the local system (in import_generic). Examples of such
filtering may be to send only relevant picks to a neighboring network,
or to change formats to accommodate another system. The intent is that
the insertion of such code will result in a new module with a name of
the form import_xxx or export_xxx.
</p>
<p>One such specialized version of export has been created: Export_scn
is a modified version of export_generic that specializes in sending
trace data. Its configuration file differs in that the user can specify
the station, component, and network names of the traces to be exported.
</p>
<p>A further modification of export_scn is export_scn_pri. This version
offers the additional
capability to specify a priority for each station, component, and
network name combination
to be exported. Export_scn_pri always transfers the highest priority
data before lower
priority data. This feature is intended to improve system throughput
during high-volume
events or periods of network degradation.<br>
To simplify the adoption of export_scn_pri, onfiguration (".d") files
are interchangable
between it and export_scn. Export_scn_pri will read priorities from the
command lines specifying
the station, component and network names, or will use a default
priority (lowest) if not
specified. Export_scn will ignore any priorities that are specified.<br>
Export_scn_pri uses a prioritized queue instead of a circular queue. If
bandwidth limitations
arise, lower priority messages are dropped or rejected before higher
priority messages.
</p>
<p>Two-way heartbeats are used to assure that the link is actually
capable of transmitting data. The heartbeats consist of agreed-upon
text strings sent at an agreed-upon rate. If a proper heartbeat is not
received in time, it is presumed that the link is broken. Both Import
and Export then log the error, close their connections, and attempt to
re-establish the link. </p>
<p>It has been found that socket-based programs which offer (rather
than accept) a connection are sometimes unable to re-establish a link
after a break has been detected. To address this, and other 'massive
failure' modes, a feature has been added to export which causes a
restart of the module in such a manner that its previous network
environment is not re-inherited. This is done by inserting the token
"restartMe" in the error descriptor file of the sender (e.g.
'export_generic.desc').
Then if the statusManager module detects a lack of heartbeat form
export, a request is made to start_stop to kill and restart the module.
</p>
<p>Neither export_generic nor import_generic change the logos of the
messages being transferred. So it is important to make sure that logos
being imported have unique logos: installation id, module id, and
message type. If the imported logos match any of the existing logos,
you will have serious problems with earthworm! The message transport
system will get very confused by these matching logos. Keep this in
mind when you have more than one earthworm system with the same
installation id that share data through export_xxx and import_xxx.
Since the installation id's and message id's (e.g. TYPE_TRACEBUF) will
match, the module id's on these two machines must be different for the
modules that are creating the messages.<br>
</p>
<p><b>export_gen_actv, import_pasv</b></p>
<p><i>Export Generic</i> makes available on a certain TCP/IP port at a certain
  IP address an export of data, and <i>Import Generic</i> makes a connection to
  that exporting machine/ IP address/ port to retrieve that data. In some cases
  this is difficult to configure because of firewalls, where the exporting machine
  is behind a firewall and can't receive incoming connections. In a situation
  like that, you can use export_gen_actv and import pasv. Export Generic Active
  exports data (as described above for Export Generic), but goes one step further
  by trying to drop off that data onto a specific remote machine and port. That
  remote machine should be running Import Passive, which sits and waits at a specific
  port and IP address for an exporting computer to connect start dropping off
  data. This moves the firewall issues to the importing machine from the exporting
  machine. In this case, the importing machine will require the ability to receive
  remote connections at a specific port; this may necessitate opening the IP address
  and port in the firewall/router.</p>
<p><a style="font-weight: bold;" name="export_ack"></a>NEW: <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">export_ack, export_scnl_ack:</span><br>
  &nbsp; This new version of export expects to receive an acknowledgment packet&nbsp;
  for every packet it writes to the socket. Creation of this new version&nbsp;
  was desired because we observed during the export of continuous trace data that
  during a communication failure, export was able to successfully write several
  messages to the (broken?) socket, but import never received them. When the socket
  was re-established, those messages were lost forever. <br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp; Acknowledgments are received asynchronously by the
socket-reading thread.&nbsp; A circular buffer, SendQueue, tracks the
status of msgs after they been&nbsp; pulled from the MessageStacker
queue. If the socket is broken/reconnected,&nbsp; export*ack re-sends
any msgs in the SendQueue which haven't been&nbsp; acknowledged. In
normal operation, if export*ack laps the SendQueue and&nbsp; finds a
message that has been sent but not ACKed, it will sleep 10ms and&nbsp;
then check status again, looping until an ACK is received before
preparing&nbsp; to send the next message. <br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp; The SendQueue length is configurable, from 1 to 254 messages
(default=100).&nbsp;&nbsp; Using a shorter SendQueue can cause a
decrease in the rate at which export will send messages. A slower rate
might be desireable so&nbsp; that an import system is not flooded by
data after a prolonged&nbsp; communication break. In testing with
export and import on the same&nbsp; machine, these are export's
approximate maximum data rates:<br>
</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp; SendQueueLength =&nbsp;&nbsp;
1,&nbsp;&nbsp; 10 messages/second<br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp; SendQueueLength =&nbsp;
10,&nbsp;&nbsp; 90 messages/second<br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp; SendQueueLength = 100,&nbsp; 350
messages/second<br>
</div>
<p>Using the default SendQueueLength, export*ack's data rate was not
observably different than export_generic's data rate.&nbsp; <br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp; export*ack requires using the new import_ack to communicate
properly. Since the receipt of ACKs is asynchronous, we may now have
the opposite&nbsp; problem to that we had before (duplicate data
instead of lost data). It&nbsp; is now possible that import_ack
actually received a packet, but export_ack didn't get the ACK before
the socket broke. In this is case, export_ack <br>
will re-send the packet and import_ack will see the same packet more
than&nbsp; once. The system running import_ack must be prepared for
duplicate data.<br>
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="import_ack"></a>import_ack:</span><br>
</p>
<p>This new version of import is required as the data exchange partner
for the new export*ack modules. However, it can communicate with
either&nbsp; old or new-protocol export modules, and can therefore be
used anywhere in place of import_generic.<br>
</p>
<p>From the first message received per socket connection,
import_ack&nbsp; discovers what flavor of export it's talking to. It
will do either <br>
old non-ACK or new ACK protocol as appropriate on the fly.<br>
</p>
<p>Import_ack has been modified to use same configuration commands as
export for setting up the server connection and socket heartbeat
strings and intervals. It still recognizes the original import_generic
commands.&nbsp; <br>
</p>
<p>Since the receipt of ACKs by export_ack is asynchronous, we may
now&nbsp; have the opposite problem to that we had before (duplicate
data instead&nbsp; of lost data). It is now possible that import_ack
received a packet,&nbsp; but the socket broke before export_ack
received the ACK. In this is case,&nbsp; export_ack will re-send the
packet and import_ack will see the same packet more than once.
Therefore, the system running import_ack as a partner to export_ack
must be prepared to handle duplicate data.&nbsp; <br>
