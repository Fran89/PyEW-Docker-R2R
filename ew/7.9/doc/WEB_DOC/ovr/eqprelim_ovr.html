<P>
Eqprelim is a first process in the earthquake-processing mega-module
(sometimes referred to as "the sausage") that produces preliminary
earthquake locations for the Earthworm system. Eqprelim is very similar to
eqroc, which produces Earthworm's final event locations. Only eqprelim, the
first link in the mega-module, is listed in startstop's configuration file
to be started by startstop.  Eqprelim then starts the next process, specified
in its "PipeTo" command, and communicates with it via a one-directional pipe.
Each newly created sub-module starts the next link in the same way.  From
startstop's point of view, the whole mega-module inherits the name of the
first link (eqprelim) and that's the only name it displays.  From statmgr's
point of view, all processes within the mega-module share one module id,
one heartbeat, and one descriptor file.  However, each sub-module has its
own configuration file and its own log file.
<P>
After starting up the next link in "the sausage," eqprelim's main job is
to gather information from picker(s) and binder, to decide when it's time
to report a preliminary hypocenter for a given event, to assemble all the
information related to that event, and to pass it on to the next
event-processing sub-module.
<P>
Eqprelim collects messages from the picker(s) (TYPE_PICK2K and TYPE_CODA2K) and
from binder (TYPE_QUAKE2K and TYPE_LINK). A TYPE_PICK2K message contains
an observed P-wave arrival-time and amplitude for a given seismic channel
along with the installation id, module id, and pick sequence number;
the picker releases the pick message within ~3 seconds of a P-wave detection.
A TYPE_CODA2K message contains coda duration and amplitude information along
with the installation id, module id, and sequence number of the pick
it relates to; the picker releases the coda message up to 144 seconds after
its corresponding pick message. A TYPE_QUAKE2K message contains an event id number, origin time and hypocenter; binder issues a new quake message each
time it associates a new pick with [or deletes pick(s) from] a given event id.
A TYPE_LINK message contains an event id, an installation id, a picker module id, a pick sequence number and a phase identifier; binder issues a new link
message for every pick it associates with (or deletes from) an active event.
<P>
Eqprelim maintains two circular buffers:
<dl>
<dt>1. Pick list
<dd>Contains the most recent MAXPCK (=1000) picks and their coda and
   link information (related by installation id, module id and pick
   sequence number) and the system-time that the pick was entered.
<dt>2. Quake list
<dd>Contains the most recent location and status of the last
   MAXHYP (=100) event ids and the system-time that the location
   was entered.
</dl>
<P>
Each time eqprelim receives a TYPE_QUAKE2K message, it checks to see how many
phases are associated with that event id. If the number of P-arrivals
associated the event is greater than or equal to "NumPickNotify" (set in
the configuration file), eqprelim initiates preliminary earthquake
processing.
<P>
Eqprelim:
<ol>
<li> gathers from its pick list all picks linked to that event id.
   If some picks do not have coda information yet, eqprelim continues
   the preliminary processing with zeroed coda information for those picks.
<li>builds an ascii TYPE_EVENT2K message containing the event's location and
   all of its supporting phase information,
<li>pipes the TYPE_EVENT2K message to the next process in the mega-module,
<li> notes in its quake list that the status of this event id is
   "preliminary location done."
</ol>
<p>
Eqprelim will initiate only one preliminary location per binder event id, so
NumPickNotify should be set at the number of phases where most event locations
become stable.  Often, no coda information or only poor coda information
is available at the time eqprelim initiates the preliminary location. Thus
most preliminary locations will have poor or absent duration magnitudes.
<P>
Note: It is possible that binder may kill an event (decide it was not real)
after eqprelim has initiated the preliminary location.  Eqprelim does not
send out any kind of "event killed" messages.  One must assume that if a
final location (via eqproc) does not arrive within a given time interval (say
5-10 minutes), then the preliminary location was for a busted event.
