<P>
Hyp2000 is the stand-alone version of the Y2K compliant hypoinverse, an earthquake location program.  Early versions of the program, written and maintained by Fred Klein at USGS, Menlo Park, ran on DEC VMS and SUN OS computers.  The program was ported to Solaris and Windows NT, so it can run on Earthworm computers.  When the user types "hyp", a command prompt is displayed.  The user will typically enter commands to load station files, model files, and pick files.  The user then types "loc" to locate an event.  Output is to the computer screen and to log files.  Hyp2000 is written entirely in FORTRAN (mostly FORTRAN77).
<P>
A DRAFT version of the HYPOINVERSE manual is available on swave.wr.usgs.gov in /ftp/pub/outgoing/klein/hyp2000/docs as both a Word  document and a postscript file.
