<br>
slink2ew is a SeedLink client module for Earthworm.&nbsp; SeedLink is
the data server component of the Seismological Communication Processor,
or <a href="http://www.gfz-potsdam.de/geofon/seiscomp/welcome.html">SeisComP</a>,
originally developed at <a href="http://www.gfz-potsdam.de/geofon/">GEOFON</a>.<br>
<br>
The SeedLink protocol can be summarized as a simple negotiation scheme
followed by the streaming of data packets from the server.&nbsp;
SeedLink packets are composed of a small header followed by a 512-byte
Mini-SEED record (data only SEED).&nbsp; The negotiation phase allows
the client to request only specified data types from the server for
each data stream.&nbsp; A data stream is defined by a network and
station code pair.<br>
<br>
By utilizing sequence numbers for each packet in a data stream the
SeedLink protocol allows for connections to be resumed, eliminating
most data gaps.&nbsp; The ability to resume data streams is primarily
dependant on how much data, time-wise, the remote SeedLink has in it's
buffer.<br>
<br>
The protocol allows for two different modes of data transmission,
uni-station and multi-station modes.&nbsp; Uni-station mode operates
by transmitting a single data stream (data from a single station)
through one network connection.&nbsp; In this mode the data stream
does not need to be specified by the client as it is implied by the
internet address and port.&nbsp; Multi-station mode operates by
transmitting multiplexed data streams (data from multiple stations)
through a single network connection.<br>
<br>
The maxium size of the TRACEBUF messages created by slink2ew is
limited to the maximum number of samples (using Steim2 compression)
that can fit into a 512-byte Mini-SEED record (721 samples = 2884
bytes) plus the size of the TRACEBUF header (64 bytes).  So 2948 bytes
is a good estimate of the maximum size of TRACEBUF messages created by
slink2ew.<br>
<br>
Version 1.1 and greater of slink2ew supports the creation of either
TRACEBUF or TRACEBUF2 messages depending on which version of Earthworm
the module was built for.  By default the module will create TRACEBUF2
messages if the system supports them and TRACEBUF messages otherwise.
Additionally there is an optional command ForceTraceBuf1 that will
force the use of TRACEBUF messages on systems that support
TRACEBUF2.<br>
<br>
SeisComP and SeedLink are actively supported by the
<a href="http://www.gfz-potsdam.de/geofon/">GEOFON Project</a>,
<a href="http://orfeus.knmi.nl/">ORFEUS Data Center</a> and 
<a href="http://www.iris.edu/">IRIS Data Management Center</a> in
addition to the user community.<br>
