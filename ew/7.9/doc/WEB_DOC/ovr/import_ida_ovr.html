<P>
Import_ida acquires data from one or more Project IDA data servers,
reformats them into TracePackets and loads them into an Earthworm
transport ring.  The communication with the data server(s) is done
using the idatap-1.2.1 toolkit available from the University of
California, San Diego via
<pre>
           ftp://idahub.ucsd.edu:/pub/pickup/idatap-1.2.1.tar.Z
</pre>
<P>
In the import_ida.d parameter file the user specifies a list of servers
with which to connect, and the list of stations and channels to acquire
from each server.  The program forks separate processes to
independently manage all communication with the various servers.  These
processes communicate through a pipe to distinct threads in the
parent.  As data packets are acquired, each child process passes them
back to its parent thread, which loads the packets into a message queue
that feeds the transport ring via the main thread.  In addition, any
child log messages are formatted into special packets that are also
passed back to the main thread and logged using the standard Earthworm
facilities.
<P>
Network timeouts are dealt with transparently to the application by
the idatap library, which will retry and reconnect as necessary until
successfull or until a more serious error occurs, at which point import_ida
assumes the responsibility for reestablishing the connection.  The
import_ida.d parameter file includes an option for specifying the policy
to follow when reconnecting after a loss of communication.  One may
chose to request the next packet in sequence (to minimize gaps in
the acquired data set) or to request the most recently available data
(to minimize delays).
