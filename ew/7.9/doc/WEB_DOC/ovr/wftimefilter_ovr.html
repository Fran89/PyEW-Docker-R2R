<h1>Earthworm Program:<br>
&nbsp; wftimefilter Overview</h1>
<i>(last revised 1 June 2006)<br>
<br>
</i> </center>
This new module was created to "sanitize" incoming waveform data&nbsp;
streams to the liking of Earthworm modules. It reads waveform data
(compressed or uncompressed) from one transport ring and writes it to
another ring, filtering out duplicate data, time overlaps and bogus
future timestamped data. Timestamp checks are done for each channel
independently. The check for bogus future timestamps requires that the
system clock is set to network time.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Wftimefilter can be configured to output the messages using the
original installation/moduleid or its own installation/moduleid.
However, it does not alter the contents of the message in any way.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Systems which are importing data using import_ack/export*ack
should probably use wftimefilter to remove possible duplicate data
after&nbsp; an import/export reconnect. Systems importing waveform data
from&nbsp; non-Earthworm data sources should also consider running
wftimefilter to ensure that only chronological timeseries enter their
own Earthworm processing. <br>
<br>
&nbsp; Modifed to allow additional optional behavior:<br>
<ol>
  <li>&nbsp; Rejecting packets that have a sample-rate different than
the expected one for the channel. &nbsp;</li>
  <li>&nbsp; Limiting per-channel logging, to limit logfile size and
increase readability.</li>
  <li>&nbsp; Adding per-channel daily summaries of errors and warnings.</li>
  <li>&nbsp; Adding the ability to issue a STATUS message to a ring as
a part of the daily summary.</li>
  <li>&nbsp; Default behavior should be unchanged.</li>
</ol>
<br>
<p>This module was written by Lynn Dietz for the CISN.
