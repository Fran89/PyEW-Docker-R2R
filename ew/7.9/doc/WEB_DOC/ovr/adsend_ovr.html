<h1>Earthworm Modules: <br>
Adsend Overview</h1>
<i>(last revised 26 May 2006)</i></center>
<p>
Adsend is the digitizing program for Earthworm. Adsend, which runs
under Windows 2000, produces demultiplexed data. It does not work for
Linux yet, but this is a work in progress. It was converted to SCNL as
of Earthworm Version 7.0. </p>
<p>This program was designed to work with a single National Instruments
DAQ board (model PCI-MIO-16E-4) and up to four MUX boards (model
AMUX-64T). The DAQ board can be used without MUXs as a 16 channel
system. Up to four MUX boards can be used, for a maximum of 256
channels, 64 channels per MUX.
Adsend uses the NIDAQ function library, supplied by National
Instruments. The NIDAQ functions may not be used in multi-threaded
applications. For this reason, adsend is compiled single threaded, and
it is linked with single-threaded versions of the earthworm library
functions.
</p>
<p>Adsend is designed to produce the highest quality data it can, but
to keep running even if there is a loss of the IRIGE signal or external
A/D trigger.
</p>
<p>TIME STAMPING ADSEND DATA
</p>
<p>Adsend time stamps the trace data by de-coding an IRIGE time
channel. At least one channel must contain IRIGE time code, which is
decoded in software and used to time-stamp the data. When the program
starts up, it will not send data until the IRIGE time signal is in
sync. After adsend syncs to IRIGE, it will keep sending data even if
time sync is lost. If the IRIGE sync is lost, a bit is set in the trace
header to indicate "time code out of sync". </p>
<p>If the parameter SendBadTime is set in the adsend configuration
file, adsend will use the PC system clock instead of an IRIGE signal to
time stamp the data. This is NOT RECOMMENDED for production use, but is
handy for testing purposes. </p>
<p>IRIGE time code does not contain the year. The adsend program can
determine the year using one of two methods. In method 1, adsend reads
the current year from its configuration file and puts it into the
TYPE_TRACEBUF message headers. At midnight (GMT), on New Year's Eve,
the year must be manually changed in the configuration file, and the
A/D system must be restarted. In method 2, adsend reads the year from
the PC clock. In order to insure that adsend and the PC clock are in
sync, the PC clock time should be updated from the IRIGE time code.
This is an option in the adsend configuration file. </p>
<p>To insure accurate time stamping at all times, adsend allows for the
use of multiple IRIGE channels. If lock is lost on one IRIGE channel,
the next on the list will be attempted. </p>
<p>CHANNEL ROTATION and the GUIDE CHANNELS
</p>
<p>Under certain conditions, the A/D system may experience
"channel-rotation", a condition in which the digitized signals appear
on the wrong channels. To detect channel rotation, adsend can monitor
one "guide channel" from each MUX. The guide channels are connected to
a triangle wave generator. If a guide channel does not contain a
triangle wave, we assume that a channel rotation has occurred on a MUX,
and we reset the entire DAQ system. The reset process takes about one
second, producing a gap in the data stream. To avoid continual
resetting, the system is not reset unless all guide channels have been
in sync for a period of 30 seconds. Guide channels, if used, consist of
2 hz triangle waves, with amplitude -1V to +1V.???? I thought the
amplitude could be variable.
</p>
<p>The algorithm for detecting the guide channel can be tuned in the
adsend configuration file. There are two threshold values. If the mean
value of
first-differences of the guide channels falls below a threshold value,
adsend will do a restart. This will occur if a guide channel goes dead.
If the standard deviation of
first-differences of the guide channels exceeds a threshold value,
adsend will also do a restart. This will occur if a guide channel is
noisy. </p>
<p>During a restart, the resetting of the DAQ takes only about a
second, but it takes about 20-30 seconds to re-sync on the IRGIE
signal. Therefore, a gap of up to 30 seconds should be expected if
there is a restart.
</p>
<p>On startup or after a restart, if the guide channels do not lock in
after ErrNoLockTime seconds (set in configuration file), adsend will
send a message to statmgr.
</p>
<p>RINGING THE COMPUTER BELL
</p>
<p>Adsend
can now be set to ring the computer bell if time code is not in sync or
the guide channels are not locked in. This feature can be enabled or
disabled using the EnableBell configuration file parameter. </p>
<p>SAMPLING TRIGGERING
</p>
<p>A/D sampling may be internally triggered using a clock on the DAQ
card, or an external trigger may be used. To insure the sampling rate
is precise, it's best to use "external triggering" from a precision
clock. We tested the system using an externally generated trigger,
consisting of a 100 hz square wave, with amplitude 0-5V.
</p>
<p>If the external trigger disappears for a user-specified amount of
time, adsend will switch to internal triggering. If this occurs, an
error message is logged and sent to the statmgr.
</p>
<p>GROUND
</p>
<p>The system uses non-referenced, single-ended inputs (NRSE). The
input signal's ground reference is connected to the DAQ AISENSE pin,
which is also connected to the DAQ AIGND pin. </p>
<p>CROSS FEED
</p>
<p>The National Instruments AMUX-64T boards sometimes have a problem
with cross feed between channels. Additional hardware is needed to
reduce cross feed, such hardware is available from VLF Design and is
being designed at USGS, Menlo Park.
</p>
<p>INTEGRATING USING THE DELL OPTIPLEX SERIES COMPUTERS
</p>
<p>When using the Dell Optiplex series to digitize, care must be used
as to
which pci slot is used for the National Instruments PCI-MIO E-series
card.
You MUST use either slot PCI1 or PCI2 (the two slots closest to the
mother board on the expansion riser). These are connected directly to
the 100MHz bus. Higher slots connect via a bridge which causes a
"bottleneck"
and may result in unpredictable errors usually culminating in
catastrophic
failure and a physical memory dump (i.e. the infamous "blue screen
crash").
For 64 channels or more, this error will be immediately obvious; for 16
channels
the error may occur at some later time (perhaps only after quitting
earthworm and logging out). As of 3/11/1999 this was an undocumented
feature (neither in supplied nor online docs), but Dell Tech Support
was
aware of it.
