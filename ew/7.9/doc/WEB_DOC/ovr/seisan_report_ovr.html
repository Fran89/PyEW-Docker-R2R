<h1>Earthworm Program:<br>
seisan_report Overview</h1>
<i>(last revised April 23, 2015)</i></center>
<p>
The <b>seisan_report</b> program watches an Earthworm ring for TYPE_HYP2000ARC type messages indicating that the <a href="eqproc_ovr.html">mega-module</a>
("sausage") has located an event, and generates seisan s-files using
parameters extracted from the messages. The program waits long enough
to allow <a href="trig2disk_ovr.html"><b>trig2disk</b></a> to have written a wavefile, which allows the wavefile name to be included in the s-file when it is written out.<br>
<br>
The program also watches for TYPE_MAGNITUDE messages from <a href="localmag_ovr.html"><b>localmag</b></a>. Parameters from these messages will be added to the appropriate s-file (which should not yet have been written at that point).<br>
<br>
The program can be configured to write a TYPE_EVENT_ALARM message to
the ring for alarm modules to pick up. This only happens upon receipt
of a TYPE_MAGNITUDE message, so if <b>locmag</b> isn't running then no alarms will be sent.<br>
<br>
The original program was contributed by David Scott and Richard
Luckette of the BGS (based on menlo_report). It has been modified to
handle S arrivals from Earthwom and to have better WAV file matching.</p>
