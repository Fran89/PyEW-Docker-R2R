<P>
This module moves messages of "TYPE_PAGE" to an external "Pageit" computer via an RS232 port.
<P>
	"Pageit" systems were developed some time ago to provide a general paging service for the seismic operations at Menlo Park. They consist of a dedicated PC running DOS, a commercial paging package, and some custom code. Their function is to monitor up to eight 'patient' machines for heartbeats and paging request. If a 'patient's' heartbeat ceases, a series of notification pages is issued. A 'patient' machine can also send a paging request, which consist of a group name, specifying a pre-defined set of pagers, and the text of the message.
