<P>
Eqproc is the first process in the earthquake-processing mega-module
(sometimes referred to as "the sausage") that produces final earthquake
locations for the Earthworm system. Only eqproc, the first link in the
mega-module, is listed in startstop's configuration file to be
started by startstop.  Eqproc then starts the next process, specified in
its "PipeTo" command, and communicates with it via a one-directional pipe.
Each newly created sub-module starts the next link in the same way.  From
startstop's point of view, the whole mega-module inherits the name of the
first link (eqproc) and that's the only name it displays.  From statmgr's
point of view, all processes within the mega-module share one module id,
one heartbeat, and one descriptor file.  However, each sub-module has its
own configuration file and its own log file.
<P>

After starting up the next link in "the sausage," eqproc's main job is to
gather information from picker(s) and binder, to decide when binder has
completed a given event, to assemble all the information related to that
event, and to pass it on to the next event-processing sub-module.
<P>

Eqproc collects messages from the picker(s) (TYPE_PICK2K and TYPE_CODA2K) and
from binder (TYPE_QUAKE2K and TYPE_LINK). A TYPE_PICK2 message contains
an observed P-wave arrival-time and amplitude for a given seismic channel
along with the installation id, module id, and pick sequence number;
the picker releases the pick message within ~3 seconds of a P-wave detection.
A TYPE_CODA2 message contains coda duration and amplitude information along
with the installation id, module id, and sequence number of the pick
it relates to; the picker releases the coda message up to 144 seconds after
its corresponding pick message. A TYPE_QUAKE2K message contains an event id
number, origin time and hypocenter; binder issues a new quake message each
time it associates a new pick with [or deletes pick(s) from] a given event id.
A TYPE_LINK message contains an event id, an installation id, a picker module
id, a pick sequence number and a phase identifier; binder issues a new link
message for every pick it associates with (or deletes from) an active event.
<P>
Eqproc maintains two circular buffers:
<dl>
<dt>1. Pick list
<dd>Contains the most recent MAXPCK (=1000) picks and their coda and
   link information (related by installation id, module id and pick
   sequence number) and the system-time that the pick was entered.
<dt>2. Quake list
<dd>Contains the most recent location and status of the last
   MAXHYP (=100) event ids and the system-time that the location
   was entered.
</dl>
<P>
Every so often, eqproc looks thru its quake list to see how long it's been
since a new location was entered for each event id. If no new location has
been seen for "rpt_dwell" seconds (set in the configuration file), eqproc
assumes that binder has completed that event.  To "finalize" this event,
eqproc:
<dl>
<dt>1) looks through its pick list for all picks linked to that event id.
<dd>a) If all of these picks have coda information, eqproc continues to
      finalize the event now.
<dd>b) If any of these picks do not have coda information and it has been
      less than 150 seconds since the picks were entered into the pick
      list, eqproc will not finalize the event now, but will wait for
	coda messages to arrive.
<dd> c) If some picks do not have coda info and it's been longer than 150
      seconds since the pick was entered in the pick list, eqproc 	assumes that the coda message will never be seen. It continues to
	finalize the event with zeroed coda information for those picks.
</dl>
<dt>2) builds an ascii TYPE_EVENT2K message containing the event's location and
   all of its supporting phase information,

<dt>3) pipes the TYPE_EVENT2K message to the next process in the mega-module,

<dt>4) notes in the quake list that the status of this event id is "finalized."
<P>
Occasionally, eqproc will receive more TYPE_QUAKE2K and TYPE_LINK message for
a given event id after it has finalized that event.  Eqproc will note these
messages in its log file, but it will never send another TYPE_EVENT2K
message thru the mega-module for that event id.
