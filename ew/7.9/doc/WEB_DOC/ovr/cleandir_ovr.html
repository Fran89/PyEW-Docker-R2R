<h1>Earthworm Program:<br>
cleandir Overview</h1>
<i>(last revised June 6, 2006)</i></center>
<p>
The <strong>cleandir</strong> program
is a rewrite of the old Menlo cleandir. Cleandir runs as a Windows
service (as opposed to running as a Windows Scheduled Task) and
monitors the directories specified in the configuration file.&nbsp; The
criteria for deletion are as follows: If any file has a modification
date/time older than the age specified in the configuration file, that
file is deleted.&nbsp; <br>
