<p> MakeTrace is derived from adsend for trace data load testing. It's purpose
  is to execute a test: To have one machine producing trace_buf's, and broadcasting
  them onto a dedicated wire. To have two machines listening: one running WaveServer,
  the other an export. To then crank up the rate of trace_buf's until something
  breaks.
<p>We presume that an adsend configuration file would be a starting point for
  the MakeTrace config file.
<p> Usage: maketrace &lt;name of configuration file&gt;
