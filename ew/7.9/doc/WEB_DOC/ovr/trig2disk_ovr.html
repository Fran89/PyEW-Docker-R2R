<h2>trig2disk</h2>
<p>
trig2disk allows an Earthworm to save waveform data to several formats:
sac,
ah, PCSUDS, Earthworm tankplayer, GSE, and Seisan. Trig2disk reads
type_triglist2k messages from its message ring (e.g. those produced by
arc2trig and by carltrig) and writes triggered data files to disk. It
uses the same putaway routines as waveman2disk. Minimal location code
support is provided but is naturally output data format dependent.<br>
</p>
<p>PSN4 format was added for windows in Earthworm 7.1 (contact <a
 href="http://www.webtronics.com">www.webtronics.com</a> for details).<br>
</p>
<p>MSEED format was added for solaris in Earthworm 7.1.<br>
</p>
<p>WFDISC format was added for Linux in Earthworm 7.4.<br>
wfdisc format can take advantage of a wfdisc params config file which must be
located at "EW_PARAMS/wfdisc_params.d" where EW_PARAMS is the EW_PARAMS env
variable.  The content of this file is very specific and allows one to specify
station/channel specific information on chanid, calib, calper, instype and
segtype.  See the command document for file syntax and formatting<br>
</p>
<p>
The ah data is in xdr format which is transparent between sun/solaris
and intel/NT so long as the ioroutin.c interface is used. </p>
<p>
The NT port of the xdr routines was accomplished by modifying the
OpenBSD
code from the ftp site at umich. Thus modifications must include this
source should be careful not to remove the copyright statements and
can't
be sold. Cavalier commenting of pieces of this source that weren't
needed
to write local xdr is ubiquitous. Thus it is not rpc compatible.

Will get restarted if restartMe is in the .desc

This module is cloned from ora_trace_save. Thanks Alex.
The putaway routines are cloned from those in earth2sac. Thanks Pete.
Many others contributed the various format putaway routines.
