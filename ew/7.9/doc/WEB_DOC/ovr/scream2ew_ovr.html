<h1 style='text-align:center;'>Earthworm Modules:<br />
Scream2ew Overview</h1>
<p style='text-align:center;font-style:italic;'>(last revised May 3,
2006)</p>

<p>Scream2ew is provided by Guralp Systems Limited and Digital
Technology Associates, Inc. The module was originally written by Kent
Lindquist and Murray McGowan, with minor modifications by Mitch Withers
and Lucky Vidmar. Source code has been provided. It was later modified
by James McKenzie and Laurence Withers of Guralp Systems Limited.</p>

<p>Scream2ew converts data from a Guralp SCREAM server (from which it
may actively request packets over TCP or passively receive UDP
broadcasts) into trace2_buf earthworm messages and puts them into an
earthworm ring.</p>
