<P>
nq2pgm is an Earthworm program for reading MiniSEED data files and calculating peak  
ground motions by the method of Nigam and Jennings. 
The routine was written for the No Cal Seis Net NetQuakes project by Jim Luetgert.
<P>
<P>
nq2pgm is designed as a multi-threaded program. The main thread loops polling
the input directory, for new MiniSEED data files arriving from the NetQuakes server.
Once data arrives, the data is read, peak ground motions and spectral amplitudes are 
calculated and strong motion messages are shipped off to the 
earthworm transport ring.
