<P>
The ewspectra module takes data from one or more waveservers, can perform a
variety of operations on that data, most importantly computing an FFT and
identifying the frequencies w/ the highest amplitudes in the resulting spectra.
Results can be written to files in a specified directory or as messages to a ring.
Specification of the timespans to process can be specified in the configuration
file and/or via messages read from a ring.
</P>
<p>
The primary option is what SCNLs to monitor and, if 2 are specified, how to combine them:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>
A single SCNL is specified & its spectra computed
</LI>
<LI>
2 SCNLs are specified and the difference between their spectra is computed
</LI>
<LI>
2 SCNLs are specified, and their spectra are deconvolved
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Other options include tapering of the original timeseries, applying high-
and/or low-pass Butterworth filters, and smoothing the spectra before writing.
