<h1 align="center">Earthworm Modules:<br>
Localmag Overview</h1>

<p align="center"><i>(last revised May 12, 2015)</i></p>

<p align="left">Localmag can run as an Earthworm module or as a
standalone program. It can be used in several different ways for
calculating the local (or Richter) magnitude of an event. There are a
large number of options that can be specified in the configuration
file or on the command line for this program. But don't let them
scare you: once you decide how you want to use localmag, you will
need to set only a portion of these parameters.</p>

<p align="left">When run as an Earthworm module, localmag connects to
a transport ring and reads HYP2000_ARC messages, produced by
hypoinverse. Localmag also uses the transport ring for sending
heartbeat and status messages as is common practice for Earthworm
modules. Localmag reads the summary line of the HYP2000_ARC message,
starts collecting trace data from one or more wave_servers, and
processes that data for that event. Once the processing (described
below) is completed, the localmag module becomes dormant, waiting
for the next event to arrive and beating its heart at the specified
interval.</p>

<p align="left">As a standalone program, localmag is run one or more
times for
each event. It can get event information from a number of different
sources:
HYP2000_ARC messages (read from standard input), SAC files, an
Earthworm
Database among others. Localmag can get trace data (if necessary) from
wave_servers, SAC files of raw trace data or previously synthesized
Wood-Anderson traces, or from other sources. And instead of reading
trace
data, localmag can read Wood-Anderson amplitudes (from SAC files or
other
sources) and compute local magnitudes directly from these. These
methods could
be used to as part of the review process after localmag module
generated the
initial automatic local magnitude.</p>

<p align="left">After localmag prepares (the new data for processing
by checking for gaps (if the data was obtained from wave servers) and
removes the mean. Then localmag synthesizes these traces into
Wood-Anderson traces. This conversion is done by a frequency domain
convolution to remove the original instrument response and replace it
with the Wood-Anderson response. The frequency response function
(generated
as an intermediate step in this process) may optionally have a cosine
taper
applied to either or both the low and high ends of the frequency range.</p>

<p align="left">When the synthetic Wood-Anderson traces have been
returned to the time domain, the peak amplitude is located for each
trace.
The search for peak amplitude is done within a time window
related to the estimated Sg phase arrival time. One or two `peak'
values
may be located. First, the largest (absolute value) zero-to-peak is
found. This zero-to-peak value is compared to the largest zero-to-peak
found
before the estimated P arrival. If the event zero-to-peak does not
exceed the
pre-event zero-to-peak by the factor <a href="../cmd/cmd_localmag.d:#z2pThresh">
z2pThresh</a>, then that trace is not used for local magnitude
calculations
and no further peak searches are performed for that trace. This
threshold
should prevent the use of station/channels that are far from a small
event or
have a lot of background noise. It may also prevent localmag from
processing
traces where one event is preceeded by the coda of another large event.</p>

<p align="left">The second peak value is a "sliding window" search, in
which
the largest plus-to-minus or minus-to-plus swing is found within a
specified
interval (normally 0.8 seconds, the free period of the Wood-Anderson
instrument.) The motivation for this algorithm is to reduce the chances
of
picking a noise glitch instead of seismic signal. When computing the
local
magnitude, localmag uses one half of this peak-to-peak signal. Note
that one
half of peak-to-peak will usually be a smaller value than the largest
zero-to-peak value.</p>

<p align="left">The Wood-Anderson traces may optionally be saved in SAC
(or
other format) files, along with the peak amplitude picks, for review by
human
beings. If pick locations are changed or bad traces are thrown out, the
traces
or picks can be read back in by localmag to update the calculated
magnitude.</p>

<p align="left">Besides the peak amplitude values from the
Wood-Anderson
traces, localmag needs the -log(A0) values to correct for attenuation
with
station-hypocenter distance. The table of these values is read from a
file. Thus regional networks can use their own attenuation relations
in place of the one Richter (later Richter &amp; Guttenburg)
developed of Southern California. This table can be configured to use
station to epicenter distance or station to hypocenter distance. For
each
horizontal component that has a valid trace (no data gaps, not clipped,
sufficient event signal) localmag computes a local magnitude value.</p>

<p align="left">The magnitude values from all the traces are combined
in the
following manner. For stations with traces from both horizontal
components
(East and North) of a given instrument band (broadband or
accelerometer), a
station `band' local magnitude is found in one of two ways. Either the
mean of
the component magnitudes is used, or the mean of the component
amplitudes is
used to compute a station magnitude. If a station has more than one
band of
instrument (both broadband and accelerometer), the station magnitude is
always
the mean of the band magnitudes.</p>

<p align="left">Finally, all the station magnitude values are averaged;
the
standard deviation and the median are computed.
These results are logged in all cases. When localmag is connected to
an Earthworm transport ring, the results are sent to transport as a
TYPE_MAGNITUDE message; other forms of output may be selected as well.</p>

<p align="left">Localmag will wait for trace data to appear in the
wave_servers,
when run as an Earthworm module. It computes the time need to wait from
event
origin until the trace window has propagted to the maximum distance to
be
used. When an event message arrives, localmag compares the origin time
with
the system time and sleeps until sufficient time has passed. This means
that
you should run localmag on a computer which is accurately set to UTC,
the same
time as is used to timestamp phase picks.
</p>

<p>Some warnings about this program: Localmag uses a quite a bit of CPU
time,
depending on the number and
duration of traces requested. If this and other CPU-intensive modules
such as
gmew are running on the same machine, they will have a significant
impact on
the machine load after one or more large events. Until Earthworm has
some sort
of scheduling system, you may want to run these programs at reduced
priority.
</p>

<p>When run as an earthworm module, localmag will gradually use
increasing
amounts of memory. This is normal. It is keeping information about FFT
factors
and trig functions, so that these do not need to be recalculated for
each
trace calculation.
</p>

<h4 align="center">Transport Ring Output Messages</h4>

<p align="left">When localmag is connected to an Earthworm transport
ring, it will send heartbeat, result and error messages into the ring.
When a magnitude result has been calculated, a TYPE_MAGNITUDE message
is sent into the transport ring. The following is an example (as
displayed using the '<a href="sniffring_ovr.html" target="_blank">sniffring</a>'
tool):</p>

<pre>1430878174 Received INST_MEMPHIS MOD_LOCALMAG TYPE_MAGNITUDE <seq: 0=""> <length: 656=""><br>567 MAG 1 ML 3.82 MED 3 6 0.12 -1.00 58.61 -1 014024006:028055006 1 0<br>GNAR.HHE.NM 3.79 58.61 0.00 -9.23E+000 1430877997.12     -1.00 9.11E+000 1430877996.74     -1.00<br>GNAR.HHN.NM 3.84 58.61 0.00 -8.26E+000 1430877990.37     -1.00 1.22E+001 1430877990.54     -1.00<br>SFTN.EH1.NM 3.94 112.69 0.00 -6.34E+000 1430877992.81     -1.00 7.81E+000 1430877993.06     -1.00<br>SFTN.EH2.NM 4.05 112.69 0.00 -1.21E+001 1430877983.45     -1.00 6.06E+000 1430877983.60     -1.00<br>PWLA.EHE.NM 3.70 193.91 0.00 -2.09E+000 1430878006.78     -1.00 1.80E+000 1430878007.00     -1.00<br>PWLA.EHN.NM 3.81 193.91 0.00 -2.68E+000 1430878005.66     -1.00 2.35E+000 1430878005.46     -1.00</length:></seq:></pre>

<p align="left">The values in the second line above are as follows:</p>

<small>
<pre>eventId MAG magTypeIdx magType magVal algorithm nstations nchannels error quality mindist azimuth author origin_version qdds_version</pre>
</small>
<p align="left">In response to certain error conditions, localmag will
send a TYPE_ERROR message into the transport ring. The message will
contain a textual description of the error. See the "localmag.desc"
file for a list of possible errors.</p>

<p align="left">As of localmag version "2.1.18 SNCL - 2015-05-05" the
program will send a TYPE_NOMAGNITUDE message into the transport ring
when an event has been processed but a magnitude could not be computed.
The following is an example (as displayed using the '<a href="sniffring_ovr.html" target="_blank">sniffring</a>' tool):</p>

<pre>1430863296 Received INST_MEMPHIS MOD_LOCALMAG TYPE_NOMAGNITUDE <seq: 0=""> <length: 55=""><br>1430863296 6 No local magnitude available, eventId=581, magType=ML, magTypeIdx=1</length:></seq:></pre>

<p align="left">The following variation will be sent if the reason the
magnitude was not generated was because the '<a href="../cmd/localmag_cmd.html#minStationsMl" target="_blank">minStationsMl</a>'
limit was not met:</p>

<pre>1430863296 Received INST_MEMPHIS MOD_LOCALMAG TYPE_NOMAGNITUDE <seq: 0=""> <length: 101=""><br>1430863296 6 No local magnitude available, eventId=583, magType=ML, magTypeIdx=1 (min num of sta for ML not met, only 3 avail)</length:></seq:></pre>

<p align="left">In the example messages above, the "1430863296" value
is an epoch time stamp, and the "6" value is an error number that
corresponds to the error-message values in the "localmag.desc" file.<br>
</p>

<p align="left">There should be a TYPE_NOMAGNITUDE entry in the
"earthworm_global.d" file for the installation. If none is found,
localmag will generate a warning at startup and then use the TYPE_ERROR
value in its place.<br>

features of this program are the result of his ideas.
</p>

<h4 align="center">Response File Example</h4>

<p>
While any manufacturer or instument might be used as an illustrative
example
for creating response files, we select a Guralp CMG5TD which has the
following
manufacturer supplied calibration information:<br>
</p>

<pre>Poles (no Zeros) in Hz:<br><br>-63.7927 +- 90.3864i<br>-209.656 +  0i<br>-755.898 +  0i<br><br>Normalizing factor at 1Hz: 1.9396e9<br></pre>

<p>
To convert from Hz to radians, multipy each pole and zero by 2pi.
The normalizing factor must also be scaled to account for the
discrepency
in the number of factors of 2pi in the poles (denominator ) and zeros
(numerator) of the transfer function. Multiply A0 by 2pi*(np-nz).
That is, A(radians) = A(Hz) * (2*pi)^(np-nz) where np and nz are
the number of poles and number of zeros respectively. So, the response
of a 5td (without the sensor gain) in radians is<br>
</p>

<pre>Poles (no Zeros) in radians:<br><br>-400.8214 +- 567.9145i<br>-1317.3 +  0i<br>-4749.4 +  0i<br><br>Normalizing factor at 1Hz: 3.0230e12<br></pre>

<p>
To convert from acceleration to displacement, multiply the acceleration
response by two factors of i*omega (-w^2). Equivalently, "add" two
zeros.
</p>

<p>The 5td sensor has a constant of about 0.256 V/m/s2.
</p>

<p>The DM24 has a digitizer constant of about 1.9e-6 volts/count.
</p>

<p>So the overall system gain (excludes any pole/zero factors) is about
7.422e-6 m/s^2 per count (or about 7.422 micron/s per count).
</p>

<p>Soo, the constant in the complete transfer function (in
microns/count
and radians) is the normalizing factor (radians) * 1e6 (microns/meter)
*
7.422e-6 (m/s^2 per count) = 7.422 * 3.0230e12 = 2.2437e13.
</p>

<p>Sooo, the complete transfer function for a cmt5td set to +-2g will
be
(in microns/count and radians) in sac format:
</p>

<pre>ZEROS 2<br>POLES 4<br>-400.8214 -567.9145<br>-400.8214  567.9145<br>-1317.3 0.0<br>-4749.4 0.0<br>CONSTANT 2.2437e13<br></pre>

<p>
<b>The earthworm transfer library (used by localmag, gmew, etc) expects
responses to be in units of nanometers of displacement</b>. The cmg5td
response
is then (in nanometers/count and radians),
</p>

<pre>ZEROS 2<br>POLES 4<br>-400.8214 -567.9145<br>-400.8214  567.9145<br>-1317.3 0.0<br>-4749.4 0.0<br>CONSTANT 2.2437e16<br></pre>

<p>
Note that we ignored the effect of the anti-aliasing filter which is
a brickwall lowpass FIR at the Nyquist frequency. It should be included
to be correct but we ignore it for the sake of simplicity.
</p>

<h4 align="center">Response File Generation from Dataless</h4>

<p>
Note that if you have the IRIS program rdseed and a dataless seed
volume for your station you can get
out the appropriate format SAC poles and zeroes file using the command:<br>
</p>

<pre>rdseed -pf dataless<br><br></pre>

Note that you will still need to add zeroes (e.g. one if going from
velocity, two if going from acceleration)
to get it to displacement and then must convert units to nanometers.
<ul>

If Input Units is METERS you're already in displacement, and don't need
to add anything to the ZEROES value. If, for example, it were
METERS/SEC, and your ZEROES value was 2, you'd need to make it 3.
  <p>1 nanometer = 1.0 x 10<sup>-9</sup> meters. So if we see Input
Units of METERS and the CONSTANT is 5.356916e+17, then Nanometers is:
CONSTANT 5.356916e+26 </p>
</ul>
