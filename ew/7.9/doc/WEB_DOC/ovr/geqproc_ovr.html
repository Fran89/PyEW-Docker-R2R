<p>
geqproc was cloned from eqproc with a few imortant differences.
First, geqproc listens for messages of type TYPE_LOC_GLOBAL
(this is hard-wired).  Glass, for example, produces this message
type.  It converts these messages to TYPE_HYP2000ARC and passes
them on down the "sausage."  Second, the message gathering, assembly and
"final" declaration are NOT done by geqproc since this functionality
has been built into glass.  Rather, the TYPE_LOC_GLOBAL messages
are simply queued and then passed on. If running binder_ew, eqproc
should be used not geqproc.

<P>
geqproc is the first process in the earthquake-processing mega-module
(sometimes referred to as "the sausage") that produces final earthquake
locations for the Earthworm system. Only geqproc, the first link in the
mega-module, is listed in startstop's configuration file to be
started by startstop.  geqproc then starts the next process, specified in
its "PipeTo" command, and communicates with it via a one-directional pipe.
Each newly created sub-module starts the next link in the same way.  From
startstop's point of view, the whole mega-module inherits the name of the
first link (geqproc) and that's the only name it displays.  From statmgr's
point of view, all processes within the mega-module share one module id,
one heartbeat, and one descriptor file.  However, each sub-module has its
own configuration file and its own log file.
