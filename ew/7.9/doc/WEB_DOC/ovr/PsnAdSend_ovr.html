<blockquote>
  <P>PsnAdSend is a digitizing module similar to ADSend for Earthworm. This module runs under Windows
  (2000, XP, Vista or Win7) or Linux and produces demultiplexed data to one of the transport data
rings. This program was designed to work with the Webtronics' 16-Bit 8-Channel <a href="http://www.seismicnet.com/serialatod.html">PSN-ADC-SERIAL
  or PSN-ADC-USB</a> Analog to Digital boards, <a href="http://www.seismicnet.com/psnaccel.html">PSN-ACCEL</a>
  (our new strong motion board) as well as the VolksMeter Sensor.
  The 16-Bit ADC board can record 1 to 8 channels
at sample rates of 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 250 or 500 sample per second. At 500
  SPS the maximum number of channels the board can digitize is 4. To use the
  board you will need one free RS-232 Comm port or use the USB version of the
  board. If the system only has USB ports, a USB to RS-232 converter can be used
between the computer and the PSN-ADC-SERIAL board.&nbsp;Adapters based on the
  FTDI chip set are recommended. The PSN-ACCEL board has both RS-232 and USB
  ports and can record up to 4 channels at 15, 25, 30, 50, 60, 100, 120 or 200
  samples per second.<P>The Windows version of the module was built using Microsoft Visual C++
  8.0 (Visual Studio 2005) and the Linux version is build and tested using
  OpenSuse 11.4. The program (PsnAdSend.exe)
has been tested using Earthworm version 7.7. The PsnAdSend module uses
the PSNADBoard.dll to interface between the program and the ADC board. See this <a href="http://www.seismicnet.com/PSNADBoardDLL.html">page</a>
for more information on the DLL / Linux library. <b>Under Windows this file must be in the same bin directory as
  PsnAdSend.exe and be DLL version 5.1 or higher</b>. The Linux version does not need any other files other
  then the
  PsnAdSend executable.&nbsp;

<h3>
<a name="Addition Configuration File Information">
Addition Configuration File Information</a>:</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>PsnAdSend Version 2 has some additional configuration file parameters;&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The <i>ConsoleDisplay</i> parameter is only used under Windows and controls
  how PsnAdSend displays status information on the screen.&nbsp; If set to 1,
  the&nbsp; program will clear the screen, reposition the cursor to the top of
  the window and display the status information.&nbsp; When <i>ConsoleDisplay</i>
  = 0, status information will be appended to the end of the screen buffer.</p>
  <p>The <i>ControlCExit </i>parameter controls how the module handles console
  event signals like Control-C. If the parameter = 1, PsnAdSend will exit, if 0,
  the program will ignore Control-C keyboard input.</p>
  <p>The <i>RefreshTime</i> parameter is used to automatically display the
  module status on the screen. The number entered is in seconds. If the user
  enters 0 (zero) for this parameter no status information will be displayed on
  the screen.</p>
  <p><i>CheckStdin </i>is another Windows only feature. If set to 1, the program
  will pole the STDIN buffer using kbhit() for any user input. Currently only
  the 'c' key is used to clear the packet received counter, all other input will
  redisplay the module status information.</p>
  <p>The Station/Component/Network/Location (SCNL) channel line format has been
  changed and the need for Nchan has been removed. The number of channels that
  the ADC board will record is now controlled by how many SCNL channel lines are
  found in the configuration file. Older versions of PsnAdSend required a index
  parameter per Channel line, this is no longer needed. The new SCNL line format
  looks like this:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>     # Stat Comp Net Loc Bits Gain FltrDly Invert Send DcOffset
     # ---- ---- --- --- ---- ---- ------- ------ ---- --------
Chan   CH1  SHZ  PN  01   16    1     20      N     Y     0
Chan   CH2  SHN  PN  02   16    1     20      N     Y     0
    </pre>
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>CH1 = Station ID; Can be 1 to 5 characters</li>
      <li>SHZ = Component Name; Must be 3 characters&nbsp;</li>
      <li>PN = Network ID; Must be 2 characters</li>
      <li>01 = Location code; Must be 2 characters</li>
      <li>16 = Number of bits to use from the ADC channel.<i> <b>See Note 1 for
        more information</b></i></li>
      <li>1 = ADC Channel Gain; Must be 1 for 16-Bit digitizer boards, can be
        1,2,4,8,16,32 or 64 for SDR24 Board</li>
      <li>20 = Low-Pass Filter Delay in Milliseconds;&nbsp; Can be a + or - . <i><b>See Note 2 for more information</b></i></li>
      <li>N = Invert data; Can be (Y)es&nbsp; or (N)o</li>
      <li>Y = Send to ring; Can be (Y)es or (N)o</li>
      <li>0 = DC Offset added to the incoming ADC data; Can be a + or - integer
        number.&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>Note #1</b>: This parameter controls how many converter bits will be
  used from the ADC channel. For 16 bit boards this parameter can be in the
  range of 12 to 16. The VolksMeter and SDR24 boards use a 24 bit converter, so
  the range can be 12 to 24.&nbsp;</p>
  <p><b>Note #2</b>: <font size="3">The Filter Delay parameter is used to
  compensate for the propagation delay of the signal through the low-pass filter
  connected between the sensor and the A/D card. This is done by subtracting
  time from the packet start time before sending the data to the EW ring.</font>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a name="Additional Derived Channels">Additional Derived Channels</a>:</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Version 2.x of the PsnAdSend Module has a new feature that allows the user
  to create additional channels from one of the real ADC channels. This can be
  used with the new built in digital filters (see below for more information) to
  send both the filtered data and raw data to EW. The SCNL line is similar to
  the normal channel SCNL control line.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>#       AdcCh Stat Comp Net Loc Bits FltrDly Invert Send DcOffset
#       ----- ---- ---- --- --- ---- ------- ------ ---- --------
AddChan   1    CH9  BHN  NC  02  16     0      N     Y     0</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>1 = Raw or physical ADC channel number&nbsp;</li>
      <li>CH9 = Station ID; Can be 1 to 5 characters</li>
      <li>BHZ = Component Name; Must be 3 characters&nbsp;</li>
      <li>NC =
    Network ID; Must be 2 characters</li>
      <li>02 = Location code; Must be 2 characters</li>
      <li>16 = Number of bits to use from the ADC channel</li>
      <li>20 = Filter Delay in Milliseconds;&nbsp; Can be a + or - integer
        number</li>
      <li>N = Invert data; Can be (Y)es&nbsp; or (N)o</li>
      <li>Y = Send to ring; Can be (Y)es or (N)o</li>
      <li>0 = DC Offset added to the incoming ADC data; Can be a + or - integer
        number</li>
    </ul>

<h3>
<a name="Data Time Stamping">
Data Time Stamping</a>:</h3>
<blockquote>
  <P>The PSN-ADC-SERIAL/PSN-ADC-USB boards and the PSNADBoard.dll can use various methods to
time stamp the data. The most accurate timing (&lt; 3 milliseconds) can be achieved
using a GPS receiver connected to the digitizer. Currently the board supports the
Garmin GPS 16, <a href="http://www.seismicnet.com/gps/gps18.html">Garmin GPS 18x
  LVC</a> Sensors or the older and now obsolete Motorola ONCORE receiver series.&nbsp;
  If the system is
running a program like the NTP, the user can expect an overall
accuracy of around +-50 milliseconds. DLL/Linux Library version 2.0 and some of
  our ADC boards now support the <a href="http://www.sureelectronics.net/goods.php?id=99">Sure
  Electronics GPS Evaluation</a> board. To use this GPS receiver the user must
  solder a wire from the GPS' 1-PPS signal to pin 1 of the RS-232 connector. To
  power the receiver from the ADC board the user can solder another wire from
  pin 5 of the RS-232 connector to the +5VDC buss on the GPS evaluation board.&nbsp;<P>PsnAdSend
  version 2.4 and above now supports generic OEM GPS receivers running at 4800
  or 9600 baud. The GPS receiver must have a 1 Pulse Per Second signal going to
  Pin 1 of the GPS connector on the ADC board. This signal must be a few
  milliseconds in duration to be detected correctly by the board. Use &quot;<i>HighToLowPPS     1&quot;</i>
  in the PsnAdSend configuration&nbsp; file if the 1PPS signal has a high to low
  direction at the top of the second. This will need to be done if the 1PPS
  signal goes through an inverter before going into the A/D board.
</blockquote>
  <h3><a name="Built-in Digital Filters">Built-in Digital Filters</a>:</h3>
<blockquote>
  <P>The PsnAdSend module now has some basic digital filtering. Each channel,
  including the derived channels, can have one or more of the of the following
  filter types:
  <blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>Low-Pass</li>
      <li>High-Pass</li>
      <li>Inverse or Period Extending Filter</li>
    </ul>
  </blockquote>
  <p>See <a href="http://www.seismicnet.com/epf/">http://www.seismicnet.com/epf/</a>
  for more information on the inverse filter. The <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/bobmcclure90/inversefilter">Inverse
  Period Extending Software filter</a> is based on work by Bob McClure.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a name="TCP/IP Connection to ADC Board">TCP/IP Connection to ADC Board</a>:</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Version 2.x of the PsnAdSend now supports a TCP/IP connection to the ADC
  board through a TCP/IP to RS-232 bridge. This can be either wired or wireless
  based on the adapter type. We have been experimenting with <a href="http://www.wiznettechnology.com/Sub_Modules/en/product/Product_Detail.asp?cate1=&amp;cate2=&amp;cate3=&amp;pid=1133">WiFi
  adapter</a>&nbsp; that seems to work Ok. To use this feature set the &quot;TcpMode&quot;
  parameter in the PsnAdSend.d file to 1, set the &quot;CommPortTcpHost&quot;
  to the host IP address or host name of the adapter and &quot;TcpPort&quot; to
  the adapters port number. The RS-232 bridge must be configured as a server and
  listen for a connection from the host computer running
  PsnAdSend.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a name="New Features in Version 2.5">New Features in Version 2.5</a>:</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>A new parameter MUX_DATA_RING has been added to the configuration file.
  This parameter can be used to send raw multiplexed ADC data as well as log
  file messages to the specified transport ring. This parameter is option so it
  can be commented out, removed from the *.d file or set to 0 (zero) to disable
  this feature. The sending of the raw multiplexed data can be used by our Ew2Ws
  (Earthworm two WinSDR) module to send ADC data to our WinSDR datalogging
  program through Earthworm. Messages sent to the specified ring are sent with
  the TYPE_ADBUF message-type tag defined in the earthworm_global.d file. The
  user will need to use an unused transport ring or define a new one in the
  earthworm.d file.&nbsp; Example:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <pre><i>Ring MUX_DATA_RING   1038      # multiplexed waveform data ring</i></pre>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left">You will also need to define and set the size of the ring in
  your startstop_*.d file. Example:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <div align="left">
      <pre align="left"><i>nRing 2
Ring WAVE_RING       2048
Ring MUX_DATA_RING   2048</i></pre>
    </div>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left">Five other parameters, all optional, have been added to the
  configuration file. The first three are used to send time reference error
  messages to the StatMgr. They are;</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left"><i>SystemTimeError </i>- Used to test the time difference
    between the ADC board time and the system time. This parameter is in
    seconds. If the time difference exceeds the specified amount an error
    message will be sent to the StatMgr. Setting this parameter to 0 will
    disable this test.</p>
    <p align="left"><i>PPSTimeError</i> - Used to test the time difference
    between the GPS receiver and the time on the ADC board. This parameter is in
    milliseconds. If the time difference exceeds the specified amount an error
    message will be sent to the StatMgr. A value greater then 10 milliseconds
    should be used for this parameter. Setting this parameter to 0 will disable
    this test.</p>
    <p align="left">NoLockTimeError - Used to test for a long unlocked time
    reference condition. This parameter is in minutes. If the ADC board becomes
    unlocked or never locks to the time reference in the specified time
    limit&nbsp; PsnAdSend will send an error message to the StatMgr.&nbsp;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left">The last two parameters are used to filter out some time
  reference log messages from going to the log file.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left"><i>FilterSysTimeDiff </i>- If the <i>SystemTimeError</i>
    feature is enabled the message below will be sent to the log file every 5
    minutes. When the <i>FilterSysTimeDiff&nbsp; </i>feature is enabled these
    messages will be blocked from going to the log file.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <div align="left">
        <pre align="left"><i>DLL: Time difference between A/D Board and Host Computer=-0.001 seconds</i></pre>
      </div>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left"><i>FilterGPSMessages</i> -&nbsp;When the time reference type
    is set to one of the GPS receiver options PsnAdSend will log a status
    message every 5 minutes that looks like this from 24-Bit boards:&nbsp;</p>
    <div align="left">
      <blockquote>
    <pre align="left">DLL: GPSRef: Sts:1 Lck:1 Sats:10 LckTm:12 10:49 Vco:48% VcoChg:00:00/00:02 PPSDif:0</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </div>
    <p>And this from 16-Bit boards:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>DLL: GPSRef: Sts:2 Lck:1 Sats:12 AdjTm:23:45.6 A LckTm:13 12:18 MsAdj:-2 MsOff:-3 1PPSDif:-1</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>If the <i>FilterGpsMessages</i> option is enabled PsnAdSend will filter
    out messages indicating a good lock status.&nbsp;</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h3><a name="New Features in Version 2.6">New Features in Version 2.6</a>:</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>One new feature has been added to PsnAdSend version 2.6. This feature,
  controlled by the <i>StartTimeError</i> parameter in the configuration file,
  can be used to seed the system time when PsnAdSend first starts running. This
  is for systems like the Linux based BeagleBone or <span class="st">Raspberry
  Pi</span> boards that do not have a Real-Time Clock (RTC) to set the system
  time after boot-up. This option may not be needed if the BeagleBone or <span class="st">Raspberry
  Pi</span> board has access to a NTP time server. A system without a RTC, or
  NTP server access, will boot-up with the system time set to a date sometime in
  the past.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>When the <i>StartTimeError</i> parameter is used PsnAdSend will wait for
  the GPS receiver to lock onto UTC time and then set the system time to the
  current date and time. The <i>StartTimeError</i> feature is similar to but
  independent from the <i>UpdateSysClock</i> parameter. The <i>StartTimeError</i>
  only checks the system time once after GPS lock. If the error, in seconds, is
  greater then the number entered in the <i>StartTimeError</i> parameter
  PsnAdSend will set the system time. Once the system time is set or the time
  difference is below the <i>StartTimeError</i> number, PsnAdSend will stop
  performing the time test. The <i>UpdateSysClock </i>should be enabled to continuously
  monitor and set the system time if the time difference is greater then 50
  milliseconds. Please note that this feature is not available on PsnAdSend
  built for Windows.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
