Liss2ew_scnl Overview</h1>

Liss2ew_scnl is the earthworm module for receiving trace data from the <a
 href="http://www.liss.org">Live Internet Seismic Server</a>. This
module was rewritten from the liss2ew by Peter Lombard and converted to
C++ when the SCNL modifications were made. This version was contributed
by the NEIC HYDRA group and has only been compiled and tested using
Windows OS. <br>
<br>
The LISS is a
very simple service that provides trace data in miniSEED format in
near-real-time
over the Internet. The liss2ew module will connect to one LISS, read
selected streams
of trace data, and write that trace data into the earthworm transport
ring.
<p>One LISS normally has data for a single station. One or more
components are sent
together in the data stream. In some cases, one component is provided
in more than
one sample-rate. The `location code' is used in this case to label the
different kinds
of data. </p>
<p>The miniSEED format may contain a few other types of blockettes
besides the
Data-Only blockette. (You can read the <a
 href="http://www.adobe.com/prodindex/acrobat/readstep.html">PDF</a>
version of the <a
 href="http://www.iris.washington.edu/manuals/acrobat/T_SEED.pdf">SEED
manual</a> if you want to know more.)
Currently liss2ew ignores these non-trace-data blockettes. </p>
<p>Besides the ASL, there are several other LISS servers. Some digital
seismographs produce
miniSEED. There is be an earthworm LISS server module, <a
 href="ew2liss_ovr.html">ew2liss</a>.&nbsp; The ew2liss is NOT SCNL
compatible yet.&nbsp; This will allow the exchange of earthworm trace
data by an alternate format to the current <a
 href="import-export_ovr.html">import/export</a> combination.
