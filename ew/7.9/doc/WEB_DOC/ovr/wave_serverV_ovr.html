<H3 align=CENTER>Introduction</H3>

<P>

This is the latest version of Wave_server as of Earthworm version v7.0.

It is based on the original Wave_server.  It supports the SCNL protocol

and process TYPE_TRACEBUF2 messages; <b><font color=red>it is not backward

compatible to SCN.</font></b>

<P>

Wave_serverV provides a network-based service of trace data. It acquires

Earthworm trace data messages for specified channels, and maintains a

disk-based circular buffer for each channel. It then offers a network service

capable of supplying specified portions of trace data from specified channels.

The basic features include:

<P>

* Up to 10 concurrent clients can be serviced. This limit may be changed to

suit the available hardware resources.

<P>

* The size of the disk-based buffer is user-specified, up to 2 gigabytes per

trace (approximately approximately 100 days, assuming 100 SPS, 16 bit data).

<P>

* The module serves either 'sanitized' trace data in ASCII format, suitable

for 'casual' purposes such as visual displays, or raw binary data containing

all information (and flaws) as received from the telemetry source.

<P>

* Several crash-recovery strategies are used to permit rapid restarts with

minimal loss of data after catastrophic crashes, such as system errors or

power loss.

<P>

* Extensible client-server protocol to permit additional queries to be easily

implemented.

<P>

* A set of client routines are available to simplify implementing client

applications.

<P>

* Handles interruptions of trace data without wasting disk space.

Event data from highly intermittent sources of event data will not be

overwritten by long periods of quiesence.

<P>



<A NAME="wsv_su"></A><H3 align=CENTER >Wave Server Startup</H3>

Following is a description of the process wave_serverV goes through when it

starts up. This is intended to give users an understanding of how configuration

changes are implemented by wave_serverV.

 <P>

When wave_serverV first starts up, it reads the configuration file, and then

starts a three-stage process of opening and checking tank and index files.

In the first stage, it reads one of the `tank structure' files (an *.str file)

if they exist. If no tank structure files are found, wave_serverV proceeds to

the second stage, below.

 <P>

Wave_serverV assumes that the tank structure file has the most up-to-date

information about existing tank files

(*.tnk) and their indexes (*.inx), especially tank file size, record size, and

tank insertion position. This last crucial bit of information tells the

`starting point' in the tank. Data just behind this point is the most recent

information in the tank. Data after the insertion point is the oldest and

will be overwritten as new data is added to the tank in circular fashion.

 <P>

The server runs through the list of tanks from the structure

file, verifying that each SCNL is listed in the config file. The one piece of

information that wave_serverV takes from the config file in this stage is the

index file size. Wave_serverV tries to open each

the tank file and its index. If index files are missing or out of date, they

are recreated by reading through the tank file. Depending on the amount of

reconstruction needed for an index, this process may take several minutes for

each tank. Note that there is no provision for checking the insertion point,

read from the structure file, against the tank file.

 <P>

If the tank and index files are read successfully, then that tank is marked as

OK. If there are errors opening these files for a tank, then one of two things

may happen. If <A HREF="../cmd/wave_serverV_cmd.html#ReCreateBadTanks">ReCreateBadTanks</A> is set, then new (empty) tank and index files

are created using the information from the tank structure file. If

ReCreateBadTanks is not set, then that tank is marked as BAD for later

disposition. Once this loop has been completed for all the tanks listed in the

structure file, stage one is complete.

 <P>

For stage two of the startup sequence, wave_serverV scans the list of tanks in

the config file. Any tanks that were not already found in the structure file

will be created using the parameters listed in the config file. Any SCNLs added

to the config file since wave_serverV was last run will be created now. If any

errors are encountered creating new files here, that tank will be marked as

BAD. Since the config file does not list the insertion point, any data that is

in existing tank files for this SCNL will be effectively erased.

 <P>

For the final stage of startup, wave_serverV goes through its internal list of

tanks. Any that were marked as BAD previously now come to light. If

<A HREF="../cmd/wave_serverV_cmd.html#PleaseContinue">PleaseContinue</A> is set, wave_serverV will remove that tank from its internal

list. Otherwise, wave_serverV will exit now.

 <P>

Once this third pass is done, wave_serverV writes its internal list to the

structure file and starts adding traces to their respective tanks. Each new

packet of trace data causes the current index entry for that tank to be

extended in time and file position. If there is a gap between the end of a

tank and the new trace data (determined by <A HREF="../cmd/wave_serverV_cmd.html#GapThresh">GapThresh</A> in config file), a new

index entry is started. Wave_serverV periodically writes the index and

structure list to disk, to save the latest information in case of wave server

crashes.

 <P>



<H4 align=CENTER><A NAME="shutdown">Shutting Down Wave_serverV</A></H4>

As of Earthworm version 5.1, wave_serverV has a signal handler that allows

graceful shutdowns (without having to stop all of earthworm.)

 <p> <strong>WindowsNT:</strong> this shutdown mechanism can be invoked in only one way: you must give
   
   the Control-C interrupt to the console window where wave_serverV is running. <strong>DO NOT</strong> try using `restart &lt;pid&gt;', as this will terminate
   
   wave_serverV immediately without sending a signal to it. Once wave_serverV has
   
   terminated and its console window is gone, you can start a new instance of
   
   wave_serverV by using `restart &lt;pid&gt;' or by letting statmgr send a
   
   restart request. This last method requires that the `restartMe' command was set
   
   in wave_serverV's .desc file. </p>
 <P>

<B>Solaris:</B> (unix) wave_serverV can be terminated using the `kill &lt;pid&gt;'

command. To stop and immediately restart wave_serverV, you can use

`restart &lt;pid&gt;'.

<P>

With earlier versions of wave_serverV (Earthworm V5.0 and earlier) the only way

to shut down wave_serverV is to shut down earthworm, using the <B>pau</B>

command or entering "quit" at the <B>startstop</B> window.

 <P>



<H3 align=CENTER><A NAME="ChangeConfig">How</A> to Make Configuration Changes</H3>

After you have been running wave_serverV for a while, you will eventually

find that you need to make come configuration changes. While you can always

shut down the server, delete all the tank, index, and structure files, and

start with a new configuration, this is usually not necessary or desirable.

Depending on what changes you need to make, existing tank files can often be

preserved. Below is a description of how to change each of the tank, index

and structure file parameters. <B>These procedures depend on having

<A HREF="../cmd/wave_serverV_cmd.html#PleaseContinue">PleaseContinue</A> set

to one, and <A HREF="../cmd/wave_serverV_cmd.html#ReCreateBadTanks">ReCreateBadTanks</A>

not set.</B> If your configuration file does not currently have these values,

change the file now to include these values. When you restart wave_serverV as

one of the steps below the new values for PleaseContinue and ReCreateBadTanks

will take affect immediately.

 <P>

Be sure you understand how to <A HREF="#restart">restart</A> wave_serverV. If

you inadvertently shut down wave_serverV without letting it go through its

normal shutdown sequence, you risk doing damage to the tank, index and

structure files. In the following discussion, <B>restart</B> means a quick

but graceful shutdown and startup of wave_serverV, using the method appropriate

for your platform and wave_serverV version. When some action must be taken

between wave_serverV shutdown and startup, that will be spelled out.

 <P><strong>IMPORTANT: Before taking any action below, shutting down wave_serverV first and then making a full backup of all tanks and TankStructFiles is recommended, if you can afford the disk space and the downtime to do it.</strong>
 <P><strong>Also worth noting: the tank struct files may take prescedece over the .d configuration file, so if you make a change to your config file, and you appear to have problems, or your changes did not go into effect, try: Shut down wave_serverV; delete the <a href="../cmd/wave_serverV_cmd.html#TankStructFile">TankStructFile</a> and if you're using it, delete the <a href="../cmd/wave_serverV_cmd.html#TankStructFile2">TankStructFile2</a></strong> <strong>and then start back up wave_serverV. The structure files should be recreated based on the .d configuration file.</strong>
 <P>
   
How do I:<UL>

 <LI><B><A NAME="AddTank">Add</A> an SCNL (tank)?</B> Just add a new

<A HREF="../cmd/wave_serverV_cmd.html#Tank">Tank</A> to the config file,

restart wave_serverV, and the tank for the new SCNL will be created.

 <P>

 <LI><B><A NAME="DeleteTank">Delete</A> an SCNL?</B> Delete the Tank line for

that SCNL from the config file and shut down the wave_server. Delete (or move)

the tank file and its associated index file(s). Then start the wave server.

 <P>

<LI><B><A NAME="ChangeSCNL">Change</A> the Station/Component/Network of a tank?</B>

Since wave_serverV uses the Station, Component, Network, and Location (SCNL) names to

uniquely identify trace data, a change to any one of these must be done by

deleting the old SCNL and adding the new one. If there is useful data in the

tank file for the old SCNL, you probably would want to keep the old SCNL in

wave_serverV for a few days after you add the new one. Unless you have near

the maximum allowed number of tank files or are running out of disk space,

a tank file can be kept in wave_serverV indefinitely without having new data

added to it.

 <P>

<LI><B><A NAME="ChangePin">Change</A> the pin number for a tank?</B>

Although pin numbers are (sometimes) recorded by wave_serverV and reported

by <B>getmenu</B>, these numbers are not currently used by wave_serverV. So

no special action is needed for wave_serverV when you change the pin number

assigned to an SCNL.

 <P>

<LI><B><A NAME="ChangeSR">Change</A> the sample rate for an SCNL?</B>

The sample rate is a critically important value that wave_serverV reads

from the trace_buf messages it records. It uses this number for its

conversions between time and sample number when wave_serverV responds to

requests for trace data in ASCII format. So it is important not to mix

trace data of different sample rates within one tank file. Usually, a change

of sample rate will require a change in the component designation (such as

is specified by <A HREF="http://www.iris.washington.edu/manuals/SEED_appA.html">Appendix A of the SEED manual</A>);

but this may not always be true.

 <P>

<LI><B><A NAME="ChangeRecSize">Change</A> recsize (record size) of a tank?</B>

Wave_serverV considers a tank file to be made up of a sequence of records, all

of them `recsize' bytes long. One of these records holds one trace_buf message.

If you need to change the records size, you must get rid of the old tank file

and the information for that tank in the structure file(s). You must shut

down wave_serverV, remove the tank and index file(s) for that SCNL, and then

start wave_serverV. That will remove the old information from the structure

file(s). To get the new tank going with the new information, you change the

recsize value in the config file, and then restart wave_serverV.

 <P>

<LI><B><A NAME="ChangeSize">Change</A> tank file size?</B> The tank file has

a moving `starting point': as new data is added within the tank, old data is

overwritten. So there is no way to extend the size of an existing tank.

If you need to change the tank size, you must get rid of the old tank file

and the information for that tank in the structure file(s). You must shut

down wave_serverV, remove the tank and index file(s) for that SCNL, and then

start wave_serverV. That will remove the old information from the structure

file(s). To get the new tank going with the new information, you change the

recsize value in the config file, and then restart wave_serverV.

 <P>

<LI><B><A NAME="ChangeIidMid">Change</A> installation ID or module ID for a tank?</B>

The installation ID and module ID in the <A HREF="../cmd/wave_serverV_cmd.html#Tank">Tank</A>

command are used as filters to select which source module should be used for

trace data. This information is stored in the tank structure file(s) for

wave_serverV. There is currently no way to change this information without

effectively destroying the information in the tank file. You must shut

down wave_serverV, remove the tank and index file(s) for that SCNL, and then

start wave_serverV. That will remove the old information from the structure

file(s). To get the new tank going with the new information, you change the

installation or module ID values in the config file, and then restart

wave_serverV.

 <P>

<LI><B><A NAME="ChangeIndSize">Change</A> index file size?</B>

The index file is always written in order, newest entry to oldest, so changing

the file size is quite easy. Make the desired change in the config file and

restart wave_serverV. If for some reason you are reducing the index file size,

the oldest entries may get deleted. That will make any trace data to which

those index entries refer inaccessible to wave_serverV. But it will not

otherwise affect wave_serverV operation.

 <P>

<LI><B><A NAME="ChangeTankname">Change</A> tank file name or location?</B>

There is no way to change the name or location of an existing tank file.

You must shut

down wave_serverV, remove the tank and index file(s) for that SCNL, and then

start wave_serverV. That will remove the old information from the structure

file(s). To get the new tank going with the new information, you change the

tank file name in the config file, and then restart wave_serverV.

 <P>

<LI><B><A NAME="ChangeStructname">Change</A> structure file name or location?</B>

The pathname of the structure file is recorded only in the configuration file,

so changing it is possible. Make the change in the config file, shut down

wave_serverV, move or rename the structure file to the desired location,

and start wave_serverV. Make sure when you rename the structure file that it

exactly matches the name that you give in the config file. Also note there

is one command to name each of the structure files (if you are using two of

them.)

 <P>

<LI><B><A NAME="ChangeIndnum">Change</A> the number of index files?</B>

Changing the number of index files is simple: make the change to the config

file and restart wave_serverV. If you have turned on redundant index files,

new ones will be created for each tank. If you have turned off redundant index

files, the second file for each tank will be ignored. But why would you want

to do that?

 <P>

<LI><B><A NAME="ChangeStructnum">Change</A> the number of structure files?</B>

There is no provision in wave_serverV to generate a structure file from

existing tank tiles. If you need to add a redundant structure file, make the

changes to the config file. This requires both setting <A HREF="../cmd/wave_serverV_cmd.html#RedundantTankStructFiles">RedundantTankStructFiles</A>

to 1, and specifying the name with <A HREF="../cmd/wave_serverV_cmd.html#TankStructFile2">TankStructFile2</A>.

Then shut down wave_serverV, copy the existing tank structure file to the new

name, and start wave_serverV.

<P>

<LI><B><A NAME="ChangeAsyncHandling">Change</A> How Asynchronous Data is Handled?</B>

Wave_serverV can now be configured to deal with asynchronous data. Data packets that

overlap in the data stream can be buffered to a database file. As data is supplied to

client applications this data can be resynchronized into the stream. There are a few configuration

commands that can be used to control this behavior. To turn on this processing set

<A HREF="../cmd/wave_serverV_cmd.html#UsePacketSyncDb">UsePacketSyncDb</A> to 1. The

database name defaults to TB2PACKETS.SL3DB but path and filename may be specified with the

<A HREF="../cmd/wave_serverV_cmd.html#PacketSyncDbFile">PacketSyncDbFile</A> setting. The

packet database is purged occasionally during runtime, deleting any packets older than

the oldest packet in the tanks. The <A HREF="../cmd/wave_serverV_cmd.html#PurgePacketSyncDb">PurgePacketSyncDb</A>

may be used to tell wave_serverV to purge the database on startup. These settings may be

modified in the configuration file followed by restarting wave_serverV.

<P>

 <LI><B><A NAME="ChangeOther">Change</A> any other wave_serverV parameter?</B>

All other wave_serverV configuration parameters not listed above may be

changed using this procedure: make the change to the config file and restart

wave_serverV.

 <P>

</UL>



<H3 align=CENTER><A NAME="Tools">Wave_serverV Tools</A></H3>

<P>

Three simple utilities are available to assist with wave_serverV problems.

They basicly read the tank, index, and structure files and write out their

contents in human-readable form.

<UL>

<LI><A NAME="#inspect_tank"></A>Inspect_tank will read a tank file, write out

a summary of the contents similar to read_index, and optionally write a new

index file. This can be used to generate a replacement index file off-line

from wave_serverV. Usage is:

<PRE>

inspect_tank [-g gap-size] rec-size tanksize tankfile-name

</PRE>

The record size and tank file size should be exactly as they are given in the

config file for that tank. If the -g option and a gap size are given they will

be used to determine where gaps should be declared between trace data records.

The default gap size is 1.5 sample intervals. By running inspect_tank

repeatedly with different gapsize values, a profile of the gap history of the

tank can be generated. Inspect_tank will prompt the user before writing a new index file; it selects the name that will not conflict with an existing index

file name.

 <P>

<LI><A NAME="#read_index">Read_index</A> will read an index file and

write out a list of the index entries (start time, end time, and tank file

offset.) Usage is:

<PRE>

read_index [-g] indexfile-name

</PRE>

The optional -g flag will change the output to a list of the gaps between

index entries, giving the start time and length in seconds.

 <P>

<LI><A NAME="#read_struct">Read_struct</A> will read a tank structure file

and write out its contents in a table. Usage is:

<PRE>

read_struct structurefile-name

</PRE>

</UL>

 <P>



<H3 align=CENTER><A NAME="Protocol">Protocol Notes</A></H3>

<P>

* The server is synchronous, in the sense that it receives a request, issues

the corresponding reply, and then processes the next request. Since there may

be several server threads, more than one client can be connected and

requesting data at one time.

The &lt;request

id&gt; was implemented to assist asynchronous clients, such as clients which

are so structured that the code issuing the requests is tightly linked to the

code processing the requests, and thus has trouble remembering which reply goes

with which request. It is generated by the client, and is simply echoed by the

server. The request id is echoed as a fixed length 12 character string, null

padded on the right as required.

<P>

* A client establishes a connection to a wave server by requesting a TCP

connection on an agreed-upon address and port number. The client may issue as

many requests as desired once the connection is made. The client may close the

connection at any time to terminate the interaction.

<P>

* &lt;s&gt;&lt;c&gt;&lt;n&gt; is short-hand for site code, channel code,

network id, and location code. The format is four space-separated ASCII strings.

<P>

* &lt;flags&gt; is currently used by the server to indicate special conditions.

Currently three flags are used, but additional flags can be added as needed.

Formally, it is:

<P>

 			&lt;flags&gt;:: F | F&lt;letter&gt;...&lt;letter&gt;

<P>

That is, it consists of the letter F followed by zero or more letters.

A space terminates the &lt;flags>. The bare letter F by itself means that

the requested data was returned; there may be gaps in the data but it is up

to the client to detect those. Currently "FR", "FL", and "FG" are implemented

to indicate that the request totally missed the tank. "FL" means that the

requested interval was before anything in the tank; "FR" means the requested

interval was after anything in the tank. "FG" is used to indicate that the

requested interval fell wholy within a gap in the tank.

<P>

* &lt;datatype> is a two character code ala CSS.  Currently, only i2, i4, s2,

and s4 are implemented. i means Intel byte order; s means Sparc byte order; 2

and 4  meaning two- four-byte signed integer.

<P>

* All times are given as ASCII representations of floating point seconds since

1970.

<P>

* Currently most of the following reqeusts and replies are handled by the

<A HREF="../libsrc.html#wscII">ws_clientII</A> routines that are included in

the libsrc part of the Earthworm source tree.



<H3 align=CENTER>Requests and Responses</H3>

<P>

<H4>MENU: &lt;request id></H4>

This request is used by a client to learn what the server 'knows'. The reply

contains the list of channels being served, and the time interval available

for each channel. The available time interval is as of the time of the reply.

The client is responsible for tracking the time delays betweeen the MENU reply

and any subsequent data requests. &lt;request id&gt; is an arbitrary ASCII

string of 12 characters or less (see above). The reply is terminated by the

ASCII "newline" character:

<P>

	&lt;request id>	pin#  &lt;s>&lt;c>&lt;n>&lt;l> &lt;starttime>

&lt;endtime>  &lt;datatype>

	  .      .       .         .          .

	pin#  &lt;s>&lt;c>&lt;n>&lt;l> &lt;starttime> &lt;endtime>  &lt;datatype>

	\n

<P>



<H4>MENUPIN: &lt;request id>  &lt;pin#></H4>

	As above, but returns the information only for specified pin number:

<P>

	&lt;request id&gt; &lt;pin#&gt;  &lt;s&gt;&lt;c&gt;&lt;n&gt;  <starttime>  <endtime>  &lt;datatype&gt; <\n>



<P>

<H4>MENUSCNL: &lt;request id&gt;  &lt;s&gt;&lt;c&gt;&lt;n&gt;&lt;l&gt;</H4>

	As above, but returns the information for specified &lt;s&gt;&lt;c&gt;&lt;n&gt;&lt;l&gt; name:

<P>

	&lt;request id&gt; &lt;pin#&gt;  &lt;s&gt;&lt;c&gt;&lt;n&gt;  <starttime>  <endtime>  &lt;datatype&gt; <\n>



<P>

<H4>GETPIN:  &lt;request id&gt; &lt;pin#&gt; &lt;starttime&gt;  &lt;endtime&gt; &lt;fill-value&gt;</H4>

Returns the trace data for the specified &lt;pin#&gt; and requested time

interval. Any data gaps within the interval are filled with &lt;fill-value&gt;. Only

internal gaps will be filled. No fill will be provided for any requested data

which is either before or after the range of the available period (as stated

in the MENU reply). The reply data is represented in ASCII as blank-delimited

signed integers.

<P>

	 &lt;request id&gt; &lt;pin#&gt; &lt;s&gt;&lt;c&gt;&lt;n&gt;&lt;l&gt; F &lt;datatype&gt; &lt;starttime&gt; &lt;sampling rate&gt;

<P>

		 sample(1) sample(2)... sample(nsamples) <\n> {the samples are ASCII}

<P>

	If the requested time is older than anything in the tank, the reply is:

<P>

	&lt;request id&gt; &lt;pin#&gt; &lt;s&gt;&lt;c&gt;&lt;n&gt;&lt;l&gt; FL &lt;datatype&gt; <oldest time in tank> <sampling rate> \n

<P>

	For the case when the requested interval is younger than anything in the tank,

	the reply is

<P>

	 &lt;request id&gt; &lt;pin#&gt; &lt;s&gt;&lt;c&gt;&lt;n&gt;&lt;l&gt; FR &lt;datatype&gt; &lt;youngest time in tank&gt; &lt;sampling rate&gt; \n



<P>

<H4>GETSCN: &lt;request id&gt; &lt;s&gt;&lt;c&gt;&lt;n&gt;&lt;l&gt; &lt;starttime&gt;  &lt;endtime&gt; &lt;fill-value&gt;</H4>

<P>

	A above, but for specified scnl name.

<P>

	&lt;request id&gt; &lt;pin#&gt; &lt;s&gt;&lt;c&gt;&lt;n&gt;&lt;l&gt; F &lt;datatype&gt; &lt;starttime&gt; &lt;sampling-rate&gt;

<P>

		 sample(1) sample(2)... sample(nsamples) <\n>



<P>

<H4>GETSCNLRAW: &lt;request id&gt; &lt;s&gt;&lt;c&gt;&lt;n&gt;&lt;l&gt; &lt;starttime&gt;  &lt;endtime&gt;</H4>

<P>

As above, but returns the trace data in the form in which it was circulating

within the system. The original trace data ("TYPE_TRACEBUF2" messages) spanning

the requested period will be returned in binary form. Only whole trace data

messages will be supplied, so that the actual &lt;starttime&gt; may be older than

requested, and the &lt;endtime&gt; may be younger than requested. The initial part

of the reply is part ASCII as above, terminated by a "\n", following that are

the  binary "TYPE_TRACEBUF2" messages. The reply is terminated when the stated

number of binary bytes have been sent:

<P>

	&lt;request id&gt; &lt;pin#&gt; &lt;s&gt;&lt;c&gt;&lt;n&gt;&lt;l&gt;  F  &lt;datatype&gt; &lt;starttime&gt; &lt;endtime&gt; &lt;bytes of binary data to follow&gt; \n	&lt;trace_buf msg&gt; ... &lt;trace_buf msg&gt;

<P>

	If the requested time interval is older than anything in the tank, the reply is:

<P>

	 &lt;request id&gt; &lt;pin#&gt; &lt;s&gt;&lt;c&gt;&lt;n&gt;&lt;l&gt; FL &lt;datatype&gt; &lt;oldest time in tank&gt; \n

<P>

	If the requested time interval is older than anything in the tank,

<H3 align=CENTER><A NAME="History"></A>HISTORY</H3>

The original Wave_server module was written by Will Kohler in a rather

spectacularly short time: We came in on a Monday to find Will comatose, all

waste cans full of espresso cups, and a working wave server.

The motivation was to support the effort with the Alaska Geophysical Institute

to integrate Earthworm with DataScope and to provide a playback facility for

testing real-time algorithms. Lynn Dietz then proceeded to add numerous

enhancements.

It stores all trace data messages received, and servers all trace data

received during a specified time interval. It can thus be used to recreate

the the pattern of trace data messages inside an Earthworm system during a

specified period of time. This has proven to be valuable for testing and

debugging, and this module still exists as "wave_server".

<P> Kent Lindquist then produced an enhanced version, including the idea of segmenting
  the tank into one partition for each trace. Since then, several authors were
  involved in wave_server development: Alex Bittenbinder wrote the main thread;
  Mac McKenzie wrote the parser of the client thread (server_thread.c); Eureka
  Young wrote the server routines; Dave Kragness pretty much re-wrote the main
  thread while implementing crash-recovery, and Pete Lombard produced the suite
  of associated client routines.

From Lynn Dietz 8/07: The waveserver messages "Circular queue lapped : 3456 messages
lost." mean that waveserver is not writing data to its tanks fast enough. This
is an obvious source of gaps in your waveserver tanks. [To fix this you] can try
increasing "InputQueueLen". Also, 270 channels is a lot for one waveserver process
to handle. We usually try to limit each waveserver process to ~100 channels on
one disk dedicated to that process.
