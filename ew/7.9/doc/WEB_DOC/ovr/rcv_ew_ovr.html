<P>
Rcv_ew receives triggered or continuous trace data from one or more USNSN
stations (collected in Golden, Colorado), reformats it into standard Earthworm
format and places it in an Earthworm transport ring. For each channel, the trace
data output by rcv_ew will be chronological. There will be no overlap between
successive data messages, but there may be gaps. The messages will likely
be of variable length, with a maximum length set by the user.
<P>
Rcv_ew is a composite Earthworm module. It is made up of two USNSN programs
(RCV and STATION, written and maintained by Dave Ketchum) that call a set of
user functions (written by Lynn Dietz) which contain all the Earthworm-specific
code. RCV is a command-line program which under Earthworm is started by
startstop. RCV handles the communication with the USNSN in Golden, receiving
USNSN packets via a TCP/IP socket or a VSAT. RCV spawns the STATION process
at the end of a pipe and passes data packets to it. STATION can be spawned
one for each incoming channel or it can be invoked as one STATION process
handling all of the channels coming in on the communications link. The latter
mode, referred to as the "multiple" STATION mode, is required for the Earthworm
implementation of rcv_ew.  STATION processes the data packets and handles all
the Earthworm communications by calls to the user functions. As the USNSN
produces internal enhancements to RCV or STATION, the new code can be moved
directly into rcv_ew. Likewise changes to the Earthworm-side user functions
can be made without affecting the USNSN code. As of April, 1998, rcv_ew runs
on Solaris only.
<P>
<B>Waveform Packet Processing:</B>
<P>
RCV receives USNSN packets from prearranged channels via a TCP/IP socket or
a VSAT. The data may be either triggered or continuous. The packet stream
can include data from multiple stations. RCV performs the recommended input
processing for rollbacks as described in the USNSN Satellite Primer
(ftp://gldfs.cr.usgs.gov/primer/Primer.eps). The data supplied to STATION is
as complete as it can be (except that during rollback some data may be tossed)
without duplicating many packets. However, the packets for a given channel
may arrive out of sequence or may overlap in time.
<P>
In the absence of new waveform data, the USNSN sends a 'keepalive' message to
RCV at least once a minute.  This keepalive ensures that the communications
link is still viable and allows the Earthworm code to issue a heartbeat. RCV
also passes the keepalives to STATION. If no data or keepalive is seen for
more than 120 seconds, RCV automatically attempts to reconnect to Golden.
<P>
After STATION receives the first packet for each channel, it watches for
sequencing errors on the channel and reports them.  STATION knows that the
rollback code in RCV has handed it as good a set of data as can be had.
Much of STATION's code deals with "Partial update" records.  These are
short packets which contain incremental parts of a longer packet. Partial
packets are used for mainly with 1 sps long-period data. Since a full 2048
byte compressed packet contains as much as 45 minutes of 1 sps data, it was
perceived as desirable to send incremental pieces of this longer packet at
shorter intervals (about every 2 minutes). Each partial packet contains the
chunk of data that has been created since the last partial. STATION puts these
partial packets in buffers. When the buffer contains a whole packet, STATION
decompresses the data and calls the user-supplied processing function
(user_proc) with the time and in-the-clear data.
<P>
The Earthworm processing function (user_proc) is configured to accept
only packets from a user-supplied list of channels (specified by a station,
channel and network code, or SCN). Packets from any unlisted SCNs are ignored,
with an "Ignoring data from SCN" error being issued. Within user_proc, packets
for each listed channel are buffered (up to a user-specified limit) to allow
for the re-sequencing of packets on rollbacks. Once the buffer for a channel is
full, user_proc will "release" (output) the oldest packet on receipt of a new,
in-sequence packet. If user_proc is handed an out-of-sequence packet with an
earlier-than-expected timestamp (a rollback packet), it looks through that
channel's buffer for a packet with an identical sequence number. If such a
packet is found, user_proc overwrites it with the newly received packet.
Otherwise, user_proc issues a "Rollback cannot be used" error, and discards
the new packet. If user_proc is handed an out-of-sequence packet with a
later-than-expected timestamp, it issues a "Gap prior to seq=x" error, and
buffers the new packet for later release. When user_proc is handed a packet
that is marked "end-of-trace-segment" (triggered data), it releases all packets
in the buffer for that channel (who knows how long it will be until the next
trigger occurs?). To "release" a packet, user_proc first discards any data in
the packet which duplicates previously released data, then it produces a
chronological stream of standard Earthworm waveform messages (TYPE_TRACEBUF).
Most of the waveform messages will contain the number of data samples specified
by the user; but some shorter messages will also be produced. These
TYPE_TRACEBUF messages are output to the user-configured Earthworm transport
ring where any waveform-processing modules can access them.
<P>
The Earthworm code also includes a thread which monitors the time since the
last data packet was received for each channel. If this time exceeds a user-specified limit ("MaxSilence" minutes) for any channel, rcv_ew will issue
an error message. It will continue to issue an error every "MaxSilence" minutes
that no data comes in for that channel.  Rcv_ew will issue an "un-error"
message when it starts receiving data for that channel again. This thread
also monitors the Earthworm termination flag in the transport ring so that
rcv_ew will exit in a timely manner when the Earthworm system is stopped.
<P>
<B>SEED channel names:</B>
<P>
RCV and STATION (as well as other USNSN and IRIS codes) use get_name() to
get SEED names for channels. This function requires that a file named
nsnstation2.dat reside in the directory in which the program was started.
A sample of this file is included in rcv_ew's source
directory .../vX.X/src/rcv.
The best way to get the most up-to-date station list from Golden is to use
the autodrm.  Send a mail message to
<font color=green>autodrm@gldfs.cr.usgs.gov</font> with the body:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
BEGIN<BR>
CLIST<BR>
STOP<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
The returned mail can then be saved as a text file and named
nsnstation2.dat. For rcv_ew to run correctly, a copy
of nsnstation2.dat must be
placed in the EW_PARAMS directory.
<P>
<B>Earthworm Heartbeats:</B>
<P>
Rcv_ew beats its Earthworm heart from within STATION.  STATION calls the
function user_heart_beat() first from within the configuration function
(user_proc_cmd), and then on receipt of any data or keepalive from RCV.
user_heart_beat() will issue a TYPE_HEARTBEAT message only if the time
since the last beat is greater than "HeartBeatInt" seconds (set in config file).
The actual heartbeat interval will be irregular since it is driven by data
coming from Golden. But since "keepalives" should come every minute, so
should heartbeats. If the communication link to Golden goes down, rcv_ew will
stop beating its heart. The rcv_ew heartbeat contains a process_id so that
the rcv_ew module can be restarted by statmgr/startstop.  The process_id
in the heartbeat is actually that of RCV, STATION's parent (RCV is the
only process that startstop knows about).
<dl>
<dt>Tip:
<dd>Set "HeartBeatInt" to something under 60 seconds to guarantee a
     heartbeat for each keepalive.
</dl>
<P>
<B>User Functions:</B>
<P>
The user functions which contain all the Earthworm-specific code
live in the source file user_proc_ew.c. The functions are:
<ol>
<li> user_proc_cmd(argc,argv)
   called once at startup of STATION for user setup.
   This is where we read the Earthworm configuration file and
   start up the time-since-last-packet monitoring thread.
<li> user_proc(iy,id,ih,im,is,ms,leap,name,cname,network,eof,rate,seq)
   called from STATION to deliver one packet of data to the user.
   This function contains the guts of the Earthworm packet processing.
<li> user_heartbeat()
   called from RCV on receipt of data or keepalive message.
   This function is a dummy function within rcv_ew.
<li> user_heart_beat()
   called from STATION on receipt of data or keepalive message.
   This function is the Earthworm heartbeat for rcv_ew.
<li> user_shutdown()
   invoked by RCV and STATION as part of the process termination.
