<I>(last revised 9 July, 2002)</I></CENTER>
<P>
The compress_UA and decompress_UA modules implement the gencompress
algorithm  which is used with permission from Boulder Real Time
Technologies, Inc., copyright 1997.
<P>
Compress_UA inputs selected trace data messages (TYPE_TRACEBUF),
compresses the samples via the BRTT algorithm, leaves the header intact,
and outputs the resulting message as TYPE_TRACE_COMP_UA. Trace
messages are selected via SCN names listed in the .d file. Wildcards are
allowed.  The compressed data output can be tagged with compress_UA's
installation_id and module_id (normal Earthworm behavior), or with the
installation_id and module_id of the original uncompressed
message.
<P>
Decompress_UA is the matching decompressor. Its output is identical to
the input to the compressor.  As with compress_UA, decompress_UA's
output can be tagged with its own installation_id and module_id, or
with those of the original message.  This option allows the
logo of the original data source to be preserved thru the compress/decompress
operation.
<P>
In order to run compress_UA and decompress_UA, you must add
TYPE_TRACE_COMP_UA message to 'earthworm.d'.
