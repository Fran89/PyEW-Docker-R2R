<CENTER><H1>Earthworm Modules: <BR> WinSDR to Earthworm for EW Version 7.x Overview</H1>
<i>Updated October 3, 2012 by Larry Cochrane</i></CENTER>

<P>WinSDR to Earthworm (Ws2Ew) is a way of receiving digitized data in
real-time using TCP/IP from the Webtronics <a href="http://www.seismicnet.com/winsdr/">WinSDR</a>
datalogger program. This module runs under Windows or Linux and imports demultiplexed data
into one of the transport data
rings.&nbsp;<P>To use this module WinSDR must be setup to act as a TCP/IP data server.
The connection between WinSDR and Ws2Ew can be done in one of two ways. Either
WinSDR or Ws2Ew can initiate the connection.&nbsp; Normally WinSDR would be
configured to listen for connections from Ws2Ew or a WinSDR system configured in
the client mode. In this configuration WinSDR would have the <i>Connect to
Client at</i> checkbox turned off and Ws2Ew configuration file parameter
ListenMode = 0. The other connection mode would be to have WinSDR connect to
Ws2Ew. To use this mode check the WinSDR's <i>Connect to Client at</i> checkbox
and enter the IP Address or host name of the system running Ws2Ew and in the
Ws2Ew .d file set ListenMode to 1.<P>This module was built using Microsoft Visual C++
8.0 and OpenSUSE 11.4.
<h3>Addition Configuration File Information:</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Ws2Ew Version 2 has some additional configuration file parameters;&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The <i>ConsoleDisplay</i> parameter is only used under Windows and controls
  how Ws2Ew displays status information on the screen.&nbsp; If set to 1, the&nbsp;
  program will clear the screen, reposition the cursor to the top of the window
  and display the status information.&nbsp; When <i>ConsoleDisplay</i> = 0,
  status information will be appended to the end of the screen buffer.</p>
  <p>The <i>ControlCExit </i>parameter controls how the module handles console
  event signals like Control-C. If the parameter = 1, Ws2Ew will exit, if 0, the
  program will ignore Control-C keyboard input.</p>
  <p>The <i>RefreshTime</i> parameter is used to automatically display the
  module status on the screen. The number entered is in seconds. If the user
  enters 0 (zero) for this parameter no status information will be displayed on
  the screen.</p>
  <p><i>CheckStdin </i>is another Windows only feature. If set to 1, the program
  will pole the STDIN buffer using kbhit() for any user input. Currently only
  the 'c' key is used to clear the packet received counter, all other input will
  redisplay the module status information.</p>
  <p>The Station/Component/Network/Location (SCNL) channel line format has been
  changed and the need for Nchan has been removed. The number of channels that
  the program will process is now controlled by how many SCNL channel lines are
  found in the configuration file. Older versions of Ws2Ew required a index
  parameter per Channel line, this is no longer needed. The new SCNL line format
  looks like this:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>#      Station Comp Net Loc Send FilterDelay
#      ------- ---- --- --- ---- -----------
Chan   CHAN1   BHZ  PN  01  YES     10</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>Station = Station ID - The ID can be 1 to 5 characters</li>
      <li>Comp = Component Name - Must be 3 characters</li>
      <li>Net = Network ID - Must be 2 characters</li>
      <li>Loc = Location - Must be 2 characters</li>
      <li>Send = Switch to turn on or off the sending of data to the ring - Can
        be YES or NO</li>
      <li>FilterDelay = Low-Pass Filter Delay in Milliseconds;&amp;nbsp; Can be a + or - .
        See Note below for more information.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note: The Filter Delay parameter is used to compensate for the propagation delay of the signal through the low-pass filter<br>
    connected between the sensor and the A/D card. This is done by subtracting time from the packet start time before sending the data to the EW ring.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<h3>
Data Time Stamping:</h3>
<P>All data is time stamped at the WinSDR server side. WinSDR can use various methods
to time stamp the data including GPS, WWV or the computer's system time.&nbsp;<P>See the link below for a list of
commands used to control the WinSDR to Earthworm module.
