    Latency Monitor Overview</h1>

<p>This program takes waveforms dropped in InRing and logs latency and outages
  of the data. Each time a trace arrives, its start time is compared to the end
  time of the last packet. When there is a gap the outage is logged to a data
  file for that station. Also, the start time is compared to real-time, and latency
  is determined. Whenever the latency changes, it is also logged with start and
  end time to the file. Latencies are grouped generally: <1' = 0; 1'-2' = 1; 2'-3'
  = 2; 3'-5' = 3; >5' = 4. Here, latency is described as present time minus mid-time
  of the packet.
<p> The graphical output shows a line for each station in the .sta file for a
  set length of time. Colors on the line represent the latency of the station
  over that time interval.
<p> This will only give accurate outage values if this module is running all the
  time the earthworm system is up.
<p> This module is strictly for use under Windows.
