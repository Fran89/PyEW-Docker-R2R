This directory contains primarily historic web 
pages, diagrams, java binaries, and javascript source.

For the purposes of expediting the RCS to CVS conversion
process, I have grouped the various files.  I have then
taken each group, tar'd, zip'd, and checked each in to RCS.

That way the files should be preserved in case they are
deemed important at some future date, but they are not
an enormous nuisance to convert or maintain.

To my knowledge, none of the files in this directory are currently
part of the Earthworm documentation pages at the Earthworm website
at http://folkworm.ceri.memphis.edu/ew-doc/

The following file groups are in this directory:

 web_report
	I don't know what this is, and why it's not in the src/ directory
  since it looks like source code, but it's properly checked in to
  RCS, so I just let it lie.(sp?)

 carl_schema_comparison_doc.tar.gz
  This is the Carl Johnson "schema comparison" document that compared
  various seismic processing schemas pre-EWDB.

 getlist_legend_gifs.tar.gz
  This is a set of 3 gif images that "may-be" used as legends for
  the Bob Simspson'esque maps built as part of the getlist web pages.

 old_web_html.tar.gz
  This is old html documents that described EW data exchange, and had
  links to helicorder displays.

 review_web.tar.gz
  This is the Quick Review distribution including html web pages and
  the Quick Review java applet.
  This also includes the "tumbler" java applet, that allowed you to
  look at picks around an earthquake(or something like that, I think)
