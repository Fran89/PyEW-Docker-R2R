Create a new top-level channel group called "Networks":
use W_ROOT;
INSERT INTO groupnodes (parent, name, open) VALUES (0, 'Networks', 1);

Create a new subgroup of Networks called "Augustine":
use W_ROOT;
INSERT INTO groupnodes (parent, name, open) SELECT nid, 'Augustine', 0 from groupnodes WHERE name = 'Networks';

Add all broadband seismic channels at AU22 to the Augustine group:
use W_ROOT;
INSERT INTO grouplinks (sid, nid) SELECT channels.sid, groupnodes.nid FROM channels, groupnodes WHERE channels.code like 'AU22$BH%' and groupnodes.name='Augustine';

Remove 3 channels from the Okmok group:
use W_ROOT;
DELETE FROM grouplinks WHERE nid IN (SELECT nid FROM groupnodes WHERE name='Okmok') AND sid IN (SELECT sid FROM channels WHERE code IN ('OKIF$ADC$AV', 'OKIF$BDF$AV', 'OKIF$HDF$AV'));
