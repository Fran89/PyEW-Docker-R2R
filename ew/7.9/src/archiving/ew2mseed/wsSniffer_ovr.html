wsSniffer is a utility used for performing diagnostics on a wave_serverV
server.  It performs two tests.  
<P>
First, it makes several requests for data
from the tank, and determines whether the actual start and end times of the
returned data are within a tolerable range of the requested start and end
times.  This range defaults to 100 seconds, but can be changed on the 
command line.
<P>
Second, it reads through the data and looks for gaps.  Gaps are found by
getting Ascii data from the wave_serverV server with a specified fill value.
If more than a certian number of samples that match this fill value are found
sequentially, the gap is reported.  The default number of samples that 
constitutes a gap is 3, but can be changed on the command line.
