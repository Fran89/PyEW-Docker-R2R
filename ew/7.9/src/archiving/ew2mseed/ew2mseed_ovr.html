Earthworm Program:&nbsp;<br>
<b>ew2mseed</b> (version May-15-2003) Overview</h1></center>

<center><i>(last revised May 15, 2003)</i></center>

<p><b>ew2mseed</b>&nbsp; is a non interactive automatic Earthworm WaveServerV
client for archiving continuous nov-overlapping time-ordered waveforms
in MiniSEED format.&nbsp; Like any&nbsp; Earthworm program, it has a configuration
file <i>ew2mseed.d</i> allowing for extensive configuration. This is where
we tell it, among other things, which waveservers to interrogate, where
and in which format to store the trace output.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
<b>ew2mseed </b>client provides the following capabilities<b>:</b></h2>

<ul>
<li>
generates the MiniSEED files on per day basis;</li>

<li>
talks to multiple WaveServerV(s);</li>

<li>
creates and updates the directory/file structure in the following format:
NET/STA/STA.NET.LOC.CHAN.YEAR.JDAY;</li>

<li>
provides extensive logging of the processing statistics (several tens of
megabytes of log files a day!);</li>

<li>
outputs MiniSEED data in STEIM1 or STEIM2 compression (configurable);</li>

<li>
MiniSEED logical record size is also configurable;</li>

<li>
the program uses SIGUSR1 signal to generate a state-of-health report (use
"kill -USR1 pid", where pid is a process ID of running <b>ew2mseed</b>);</li>

<li>
location code is supported;</li>

<li>
supports 4 levels of verbosity;</li>

<li>
provides a catch-up algorithm to boost a transmission of data from the
late channels;</li>

<li>
supports locking mechanism preventing multiple copies of <b>ew2mseed </b>to
operate over the same configuration file.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
Runtime operation</h2>
When started, <b>ew2mseed</b> searches the structure NET/STA/ in the directory&nbsp;
defined by the configuration parameter MseedDir&nbsp; for the filenames
in the format STN.NET.LOC.CHAN.YEAR.JDAY, where julian day is always represented
by 3 digits. If the file for a specific SCN does not exist, this file is
created by <b>ew2mseed</b>. The date extension of this file (YEAR.JDAY)
is set either to
<br>(1a) the date defined by the beginning of the earthworm tank file (in
case the parameter StartTime is omitted in <i>ew2mseed.d</i> or StartTime
is older than the
<br>beginning of the tank);
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or
<br>(1b) If the StartTime is younger than the beginning of the&nbsp; tank,&nbsp;
the filename date extension (YEAR and JDAY) is set to the date of StartTime.
<p>Data collection starts in case (1a) from the beginning of the tank and
in case (1b) from the time marked by StartTime parameter.
<p>If at the invocation of <b>ew2mseed</b>, at least a single file containing
MiniSEED records in the correct format do exist in the directory for the
particular SCN, <b>ew2mseed </b>compares three parameters ((1) most recent
date and time in the most recent data file; (b) time of StartTime parameter;
and (c) the beginning time in the Earthworm tank). The program uses the
most recent time among (a), (b), and (c) as the starting time for data
retrieva<b>l.</b>
<p><b>ew2mseed</b> will
<br>(2a) create a new file STN.NET.LOC.CHAN.YEAR1.JDAY1 for&nbsp; data
beginning at YEAR1 JDAY1&nbsp; if such file does not exist;
<br>or
<br>(2b) will use the existing file if the file in the with YEAR1 and JDAY1
exist is for the this STN.NET.LOC.CHAN.
<p>The considerations for&nbsp; a complex design described above are the
following:
<br>(a) <b>ew2mseed</b> is intended to grab as much data points from the
WaveServer&nbsp; as possible in an automatic mode.
<br>(b) It is assumes that if the data for the particular date are written
into the file of it's directory structure, the data for&nbsp; all previous
days have are also processed if <b>ew2mseed</b> operates constantly.
<p>The obvious flip side of such an approach is that as long as the file
STN.NET.LOC.CHAN.YEAR1.JDAY1 exists in the directory structure with at
least a single
<br>valid MiniSEED block, there is no way to force <b>ew2mseed </b>to get
data before YEAR1 JDAY1 and before time defined by the latest MiniSEED
block.
<p>The following is also true: removing the files from the specific directory
for the particular SCN followed by a&nbsp; restart of <b>ew2mseed</b> would
create a situation defined as
<br>cases (1a) and (1b) above: <b>ew2mseed</b> might start extracting data
which have already been received.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
Unavailable SCNs :</h2>
When <b>ew2mseed </b>is started, it attempts to receive a small portion
of data for each SCNs. If for some reason even a single snippet for a particular
SCN is not available, <b>ew2mseed </b>removes this SCN from the processing
ring and documents this channel in the regular LOG file and also writes
SCN parameters into the LOCK file. Therefore, a LOCK file for a particular
<b>ew2mseed
</b>process
contains an information about the unavailable SCNs during the lifetime
of this
<b>ew2mseed </b>process. If the LOCK file is not used,
<b>ew2mseed
</b>writes
an information about unavailable SCNs into the stderr channel.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
Features and limitations of <b>ew2mseed</b>:</h2>

<ul>
<li>
This version runs on <b><u>UNIX/SOLARIS</u></b> platform only;</li>

<li>
Every instance of <b>ew2mseed </b>creates a log file in the directory defined
by the environmental variable EW_LOG. The structure of the log file name
is&nbsp; CONF_FILE_NAME + 0.log_ + current date, where CONF_FILE_NAME is
the configuration file name with extension removed. For example, "<b>ew2mseed</b><i>
ew2mseed1.d"</i> created log file ew2mseed10.log_20010118 on 18 January
2001. To force multiple instances of<b> ew2mseed </b>to log into different
files, the CONF_FILE_NAMEs should be different;</li>

<li>
The program writes large data files and log files. It does not check for
the available disk space;</li>

<li>
The productivity of the program is mostly limited by the bandwidth of the
TCP/IP connection. The program does not put a limit on the number of SCNs
it reads from. Therefore, if there are too many SCNs, the speed of removing
data from the WaveServerV can exceed the speed of reading and processing
data by <b>ew2mseed</b> . This will lead to the additional tears in the
disk MiniSEED files;</li>

<li>
The program uses SIGUSR1 signal to generate state-of-health reports. Nevertheless,
the parameters to be included in the report are yet to be refined;</li>

<li>
The program does not support "wild cards", therefore, all SCNs should be
listed in the <i>ew2mseed.d</i> file in explicit form;</li>

<li>
&nbsp;WaveServerV is currently not warranted from havin OVERLAPPED snippets.
OVERLAPPED snippet is defined as one with a starttime being earlier than
the previous snippet endtime. OVERLAPPED snippets are discarded by <b>ew2mseed</b>
and every instance of OVERLAP is logged. Removing of OVERLAPPED snippets
create gaps. Overlapped snippets might indicate problems with the original
data in WaveServerV.</li>

<li>
Removing the most recent files from active directories for SCNs during
the <b>ew2mseed</b> operation can lead to the catastrophic consequences
and is prohibited.</li>

<br>Running more than a single copy of <b>ew2mseed</b> for for the same
SCN/Location/file structure is prohibited.&nbsp; Despite we implemented
a locking mechanism preventing more then one copy of <b>ew2mseed</b> to
operate over a particular
<i>ew2mseed.d.x</i> file, there is no automatic
way to prevent two <b>ew2mseed</b>&nbsp; with different <i>ew2mseed.d.x</i>
configuration files to write to the same&nbsp;&nbsp; /NET/STN/STN.NET.LOC.CHAN.YEAR.JDAY.</ul>

<h2>
Using ew2mseed with multiple WaveServers:</h2>

<ul>1. Here we walk a reader through the steps of the <b>ew2mseed</b> program
from the standpoint of multiple WaveServers usage.
<br>Multiple WaveServers are set in the configuration file as key word
WaveServer followed by the IP:Port, where IP address can also be human
readable computer
<br>name which will be resolved by gethostbyname() system call.
<p><i># frame relay..</i>
<br><i>WaveServer 192.168.12.10 16022</i>
<br><i># harry...</i>
<br><i>WaveServer 136.177.31.188 16022</i>
<br><i># harry2...</i>
<br><i>WaveServer 136.177.31.10 16022</i>
<p>2. All available WaveServers are first registered in the configuration
structure of <b>ew2mseed</b>.&nbsp; If we follow the example configuration
above, in particular,
<br>there will be created a WaveServer linked list containing 3 WaveServers.
<p>3.&nbsp; ew2mseed calls a function&nbsp; int processWsAppendMenu (RINGS
*rn, WS_MENU_QUEUE_REC *menu) , which uses EW library function wsAppendMenu()
<br>in a loop for each WaveServer. wsAppendMenu() can either append a current
WaveServer menu or return an error indicating that the connection to the
<br>WaveServer is not available. The main task of processWsAppendMenu ()
is to fill up the WaveServers structure WS_MENU_QUEUE_REC *menu. This
<br>structure is later used for getting data snippets. As long as at least
a single WaveServer is available, the WS_MENU_QUEUE_REC *menu structure
is not NULL
<br>and function processWsAppendMenu () returns the number of available
WaveServers from the list. If no WaveServers are available, processWsAppendMenu
()
<br>does not return. In this case it idles for 20 seconds and attempt to
connect to WaveServers again. An operator can examine the log file and
kill the instance
<br>of <b>ew2mseed </b>manually if he/she realizes that the WaveServers
declared in the configuration will not be available.
<p>4. Let us suppose that we passed the stage (3) and found out that, for
example, two out of three WaveServers declared in the configuration file
are running and their
<br>data are available.&nbsp; We now search through every available WaveServer
and create a list of available PSCNs. If no PSCNs is available, the program
quits.
<p>5. If we are here, it means that more than 0 WaveServers provide more
than zero PSCNs.&nbsp; In other words we entered the main loop of <b>ew2mseed</b>.
<br>In the main loop, the core call is to
<br>int wsGetTraceBin( TRACE_REQ* getThis, WS_MENU_QUEUE_REC* menu_queue,&nbsp;
int timeout ).&nbsp; wsGetTraceBin() is a library function from WaveClient
<br>library and it is declared as being able to extract data from multiple
waveServers. Here is an extract from wsGetTraceBin() documentation:
<p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Retrieves the piece of raw trace data specified in the</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
structure 'getThis': The current menu list, as built by the</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
routines above will be searched for a matching SCN. If a match</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
is found, the associated wave server will be contacted, and a</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
request for the trace snippet will be made. If a server returns</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
with a flag (request in gap or outside of tank), another server</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
in the menu queue will be tried. (<a href="http://www.cnss.org/EWAB/libsrc.html">http://www.cnss.org/EWAB/libsrc.html</a>)</i>
<p>6. Once in while (when ew2mseed read all data until the endTime of the
tank for a particular PSCN),&nbsp; <b>ew2mseed</b> calls a function
<br>int updateMenu (RINGS *rn, WS_MENU_QUEUE_REC *menu_queue), which updates
local copies of menus of WaveServers and includes/excludes
<br>from the WaveServer's linked list those WaveServers which&nbsp; became
available/unavailable.
<h2>
Catch-up algorithm (new in version 02-Apr-2002):</h2>
The problem description: ew2mseed receives high volume of data from heterogeneous
set of channels; due to the various reasons (connection speed is
<br>&nbsp;the most important), some channels are later than the others.
We implemented an algorithm which forces&nbsp; ew2mseed to request more
information from the
<br>&nbsp;later channels.
<p>&nbsp; 1) Each channel has a configuration structure. We add a new integer
field "Priority" which indicates&nbsp; a factor at&nbsp; which we increase
<br>the parameter RecordNumber for a given station. That is, if&nbsp; Priority&nbsp;
is 2 for a channel, it will poll twice&nbsp; more data form the WaveServer
<br>relative to the channels with GetTraceTimes = 1. At the init stage
each channel sets "Priority" to the default 1.
<p>&nbsp;2)&nbsp; We count number of loops over all channels.&nbsp; After
<b>LoopsBeforeService </b>(configurable parameter, <u>default value = 50</u>)&nbsp;
production loops&nbsp; for each channel we compute the
<br>&nbsp; TIME of the snippet we currently process and&nbsp; AVERAGE TIME
for all channels.
<p>&nbsp;4) Next for each channel we compute Priority as: if the processing
time on the channel is less than&nbsp; N days&nbsp; later than the Average,
we
<br>assign N+1 to GetTraceTimes, if the average time is later than the
channel processing time, we set 1 to GetTraceTime.
<br>GetTraceTimes is bounded by 1 as the lowest limit and by the configurable
parameter <b>PriorityHighWater </b>(<u>default value = 5</u>).
<br>Next, we increase/decrease the requested time limits for a request
to the WaveServerV proportinally to the "Priority" parameter.
<p>&nbsp;5) Goto 2.
<p><b><font size=+2>StartLatency parameter (new in version 15-May-2003):</font></b>
<br><font size=-1>StartLatency parameter in hours is used to superseed
StartTime parameter.&nbsp; The starttime is computed as the current time
minus StartLatency and the resultanant number is used</font>
<br><font size=-1>to compute StartTime. Either StartTime or StartLatency
must be present in the configuration file.&nbsp; If both of them are present,
the program will use the parameter which is below</font>
<br><font size=-1>than the other one in the configuration file.</font>
<br>&nbsp;</ul>
