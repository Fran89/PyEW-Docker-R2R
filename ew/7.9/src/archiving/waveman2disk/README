waveman2disk is a manual, interactive, non-earthworm module version
of trig2disk. Its purpose is to save trace data to disk in variuos
supported formats - currently ah, sac, and pc-suds. Like any good
earthworm program, it has a configuration file waveman2disk.d allowing
for extensive configuration. This is where we tell it, among other
things, which waveservers to interrogate, where and it which format to
store the trace output,

  waveman2disk works in two modes:

(1) Emergency (interactive):  the config file lists the output format 
      and location, as well as the channels to save. The user is prompted 
      for the start and end time of trace data to be saved.

(2) Trigger-saving: a file, specified in the config file, contains
      ascii text of one or more TYPE_TRIGLIST messages. These are processed
      one at a time, and the trace data of the channels listed in the
      TRIGLIST message, are saved to disk.



Note on output formats:

 the trig2disk module has been extensively re-packaged to allow
for easier addition and modification of output formats. Basically,
all functionality dealing with producing output on disk has been 
moved into libsrc/util. The putaway.c file contains entry points
into the trace writing system. This is where any new output format
should be added. Associated with it are files like sacputaway.c,
sudsputaway.c and ahputaway.c that actually implement the writing
of various output formats to disk.
