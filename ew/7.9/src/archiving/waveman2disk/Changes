Changes to trig2disk, waveman2disk, and putaway routines

1. Reorganized *head.h files: all function prototypes of the specific *putaway
   routines that are called by putaway.c are now in pa_subs.h; it is likely
   that putaway.c is the only file that will need pa_subs.h.  Other *head.h
   files are split into *head.h for things that only have to do with this
   format's header (ahhead.h, sachead.h, sudshead.h) and *putaway.h for things
   needed by the putaway routines (sacputaway.h).

2. In ahputaway.c, moved mallocs to AHPA_init instead of in AHPA_next_evt.
   Removed different path delimiters; '/' works for both NT and Unix.

3. Reorganized *PA_next for all putaway routines except tankputaway to be more
   efficient about transfering data from TRACEBUF to file buffers.
   Removed mapping of NC component names into SEED standard names.
   Rationalized logit calls: errors should go to STDERR; debugs should not.

4. Changed suds_putaway.c so that it clips data to MIN_SHRT/MAX_SHRT instead
   of truncating it. Now a warning is issued as well. Initialized structures
   before writing SUDS files. 

5. Created putaway.h; removed the PA_* function prototypes from waveman2disk
   and trig2disk.

6. Removed MaxTraceMsg argument from PA_init(); it was only used by
   TANKPA_init and is not needed now that tankputaway.c has been fixed.

7. Removed several unneeded includes from all putaway sources; removed several
   unneeded libs from makefiles.

8. Removed an unnecessary SACHEAD buffer and associated memcpy from
   sacputaway.c; simplified swapsac function. Added lines to SACmac_repick to
   turn off the annoying SAC bell.

9. Added cpp commands to prevent multiple inclusions of several header files.

10. Moved xdr* files (used only on NT) from trig2disk and waveman2disk to
    libsrc/winnt/rpc. 

11. Enclosed C++ comments in sudsputaway.h in C-style comments. Makes the C
    compiler much happier.

12. Cleaned up lots of comments and indentation.

13. Added three functions to mem_circ_queue.c: dumpqueue() to write the queue
    to file; undumpqueue() to read from file back into memory; and
    peekNextElement(), to see what's next in the queue without removing
    it. These are needed for changes to trig2disk.

14. Waveman2disk: removed part of WriteEvent that was collecting waitTimes
    from wave_serverV; it was never implemented. Removed MaxTraceMsg and
    TravelTimeout from config file; not used any more. Tried to fix confusing
    settings of "EventId" and "EventID" (two different variables apparently
    for the same value.) Cleaned up match() function to make it more
    efficient. Fixed CatPseudoTrig.c so it won't overflow its buffer; made it
    more efficient.

15. trig2disk: All of waveman2disk fixes plus: removed pin number from
    TrigStation config command. Added optional QueueFile and QueueSize
    parameters: the first allows for saving the queue to disk and loading it
    on restart; the second adjusts the queue size (used to be fixed at 10
    entries.) Added optional DelayTime parameter to config file. This will
    delay the processing of a trigger message for this many seconds from time
    of receipt. Cleaned up terminate processing to prevent crashes. Took
    SocketSysInit() out of loop: it must only be called once on NT.
