The wave_serverV TANK structure changed after v3.2, adding some elements to
the structure. One of the new elements is used to keep track of index
overwrites. (The new structure includes some empty elements for future use,
hopefully precluding the need to translate old structures to new ones.

The utility program fix4_3.3 is provided to translate the v3.2 (or earlier)
tank file structures to the new (version 3.3) structures. There are one or two
of these files for each wave_serverV and have the string ".str" at the end of
their file names.

***** NOTE ***** A bug in v3.2 wave_serverV caused the tank index files (*.inx
* files) to become corrupted after they filled up. The most likely way for the
* index files to fill up is for the tank data to be so badly fragmented (lots
* of gaps) that the index files run out of entries. This condition will show
* up in the wave_serverV log: "wave_serverV: Ran out of free indexes." A more
* reliable way to see if the index file has filled up is to check its file
* size. If the index file size in bytes is exactly 24 times the "Index Size"
* parameter in wave_serverV.d, then the file has not filled up and should be a
* good file. If the index file size is 12 bytes more than 24 times the "Index
* Size", then the index file has filled up and may be corrupted.
*
* If the index file(s) for a tank are corrupted, they should be removed
* because the wave_serverV (any version) may hang when it tries to read them
* on startup. Since it may take a long time to recreate the index from a badly
* fragmented tank, the tank file should probably be deleted at the same time
* as the index files are removed.

To use fix4_3.3 to translate the structure files: 

shut down earthworm so that the running v3.2 wave_serverV can save its tanks
and exit normally.  
Change directory (cd) to the tank directory. 
Run fix4_3.3 on each of the structure files:
   fix4_3.3 p1000-1.str; fix4_3.3 p1000-2.str
This will create new files p1000-1.str.new and p1000-2.str.new, leaving the
old structure files unchanged. 
Rename the old and new structure files:
   mv p1000-1.str p1000-1.str.old
   mv p1000-1.str.new p1000-1.str
   mv p1000-2.str p1000-2.str.old
   mv p1000-2.str.new p1000-2.str

Now the v3.3 wave_serverV can use these tank structure files.
