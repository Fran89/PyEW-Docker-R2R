Hypoinverse 2000

Notes July 5 2002, revised Nov 21, 2005 and Feb 28, 2007.

Various versions of the Hypoinverse earthquake location program have
been in wide use since 1979.  Functional improvements to the program
have been incremental, and the current release is of this incremental
type.  This release is different because there is now an "official
director approved" open-file document to accompany the program, which
explains the program in more detail than most users probably need.  To
honor the rare occasion of a coincidence of program functionality and
documentation, I am assigning it the name hypoinverse 2000 version
1.0.

Users probably don't need to update their program code (unless they
need the new 2-letter station location codes because they have so many
station codes that they need 12 characters to distinguish them).  If
you have an old version, just be advised that the current open file
report will describe all features you already have and others that you
would get if you updated your code.  

The program documentation is available as an open file report "User's
guide to HYPOINVERSE-2000, a fortran program to solve for earthquake
locations and magnitudes", USGS Open file report 02-171, 2002.  The
easiest way to get it is from the site

http://geopubs.wr.usgs.gov/open-file/of02-171 

as an Adobe acrobat pdf file for reading or printing.  You can also get
a Microsoft Word 2000 document from

ftp://ehzftp.wr.usgs.gov/klein/hyp2000/docs/

There is a pdf file in the same ftp directory.

Any revised versions will be posted to the ehzftp site before the
geopubs site.


The program called hyp2000 is available by anonymous ftp.  It has been
revised and tested for several years.  Go to

ftp://ehzftp.wr.usgs.gov/klein/hyp2000/

The program executable is this parent directory, and the fortran souce
files are in the subdirectories called source and subsdir.  The
executable is for sun/solaris with fortran libraries bound inside, so
you should not need fortran on your sun unix computer to execute. I do
not have executable files for other platforms.

The code compiles under solaris or sun-os, under VMS, and also g77
under sun unix. I think this means the code is linux compatible.
Source code is in fortran 77 with some sun/vms entensions.  A few small
subroutines come in both sun (*.f) and VMS (*.for) versions, but 99% of
the code is identical.  If there is only a *.for version in the
directory, it compiles under both systems.  Source code and a sample
makefile are in the klein/hyp2000/source directory.  You will need to
modify the makefile for your computer.

The VMS version will do input and output to CUSP *.mem files.  We are
using it to read mem files and output ASCII archive files, including
shadow cards, for our catalog.  CUSP subroutines are in the /cusp
directory.  Hypoinverse functions independently of being in the CUSP
environment.  You just have to have an event-ddl file and define the
path to it.  See the documentation for more details. [We ceased CUSP
processing in late 2006 and early 2007.]

You can make a VMS version without the CUSP functions by using the
dummy subroutines for the unix version (for example, use hycin.f
instead of hycin.for).

The standard subroutines (common to many of my programs) are in the
/subsdir subdirectory.

Many other related files such as the program ttgen, NCSN stations and
NCSN Hypoinverse control files may be under ftp://ehzftp.wr.usgs.gov/klein/.
