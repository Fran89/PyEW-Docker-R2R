Notes for Hypoinverse 2000, version 1.1, Feb. 28, 2007

This README1.1 file is a supplement to the original README1.0 file. There
is now a revised release in which the program, source code,
documentation, and new test files are all self-consistent and up to
date.

Version 1.1 adds the ability to fix the origin time (see the terminator
card format), initial distance weighting for the first iterations (DI1
command), label earthquakes with the domain and version of processing
used (VER command), labeling phases with an alternate 3-letter
component code (copied from the station card to the archive line),
translate CUSP digitizer codes to data source codes (DID and DIG
commands), and some complexities for assigning and labeling amplitude
magnitudes as either MX (velocity) or ML (local) (see the XMT command
and new fields at the end of the station archive format lines).

Version 1.1 compiles successfully under the g77 compiler (as well as
the sun f77 compiler), which I understand means the code is linux
compatible.

A new version (1.1) of the documentation is available as a Word doc
file and as a pdf file. Changes include the new commands and the
additional fields in the output formats.

There are now tar files available for the Hypoinverse source code and
data test files. You can also examine and download individual files
from the website. All files are available at
