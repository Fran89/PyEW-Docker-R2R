Files rayloc_message_rw.h and rayloc_message_rw.c contain
API for reading and writing TYPEi_RAYLOC messages.

File rayloc_message_rw.h is installed in $EW_HOME/include
File rayloc_message_rw.o is installed in $EW_HOME/lib

Protocol and formats are described in the comments of 
rayloc_message_rw.h

Separate program read_rayloc_msg has been written as an
example of the code which reads and parses 
TYPE_RAYLOC msg.

20071205 update from Mitch Withers.  Synced rayloc_ew with ray_loc
from Hydra.  Involved changes to ellip.f and robust_util.f.  Also
needs a new prm file that I had previously allowed to reside in
the glass model dir.  Added that dir and its contents along with
the new res_ac.prm file to rayloc_ew's directory.  There are also
problems with the hydra ew that should be fixed.

A known feature is rayloc will complain with a less than illuminating
error when a station is missing from the station file.  Something like:

20071205_UTC_15:12:50 lib_rayloc: Failed to write Input Structure to the file /g
aia/home/mwithers/Projects/EWSupport/Working/run_smeagol/model/RayLocInputa.txt

 is NULL
20071205_UTC_15:12:50 Failed to convert RAYLOC message into structure

You have been warned.
