<P>
Eqassemble is the first process in the earthquake-processing mega-module
(sometimes referred to as "the sausage") that produces earthquake
locations for the Earthworm system. Only eqassemble, the first link in the
mega-module, is listed in startstop's configuration file to be started
by startstop. Eqassemble then starts the next process, specified in its
"PipeTo" command, and communicates with it via a one-directional pipe.
Each newly created sub-module starts the next link in the same way. From
startstop's point of view, the whole mega-module inherits the name of
the first link (eqassemble) and that's the only name it displays. From
statmgr's point of view, all processes within the mega-module share one
module id, one heartbeat, and one descriptor file. However, each
sub-module has its own configuration file and its own log file.
<P>

Eqassemble is the result of merging three other Earthworm programs: eqprelim,
eqrapid (used only at Caltech), and eqproc. This merger was needed for the
CISN project. It results in a single module that can release event messages
meeting any of three different rule sets that are derived from the original
programs' rules. By merging the three programs into one, we also gain by
having to run only a single sausage instead of three.
<P>

After starting up the next link in "the sausage," eqassemble's main job is to
gather information from picker(s) and binder, to decide when en event is ready
for release, to assemble all the information related to that event, and to
pass it on to the next event-processing sub-module.
<P>

Eqassemble collects messages from the picker(s) (TYPE_PICK_SCNL and
TYPE_CODA_SCNL) and from binder (TYPE_QUAKE2K and TYPE_LINK). A TYPE_PICK_SCNL
message contains an observed P-wave (or S-wave) arrival-time and amplitude for
a given seismic channel along with the installation id, module id, and pick
sequence number; the picker releases the pick message within ~3 seconds of a
P-wave detection. A TYPE_CODA_SCNL message contains coda duration and
amplitude information along with the installation id, module id, and sequence
number of the pick it relates to; the picker releases the coda message up to
144 seconds after its corresponding pick message. A TYPE_QUAKE2K message
contains an event id number, origin time and hypocenter; binder issues a new
quake message each time it associates a new pick with [or deletes pick(s)
from] a given event id. A TYPE_LINK message contains an event id, an
installation id, a picker module id, a pick sequence number and a phase
identifier; binder issues a new link message for every pick it associates with
(or deletes from) an active event.
<P>

Eqassemble maintains two circular buffers:

<dl>
<dt>1. Pick list
<dd>Contains the most recent MAXPCK (=1000) picks and their coda and
    link information (related by installation id, module id and pick
    sequence number) and the system-time that the pick was entered.
<dt>2. Quake list
<dd> Contains the most recent location and status of the last MAXHYP
    (=100) event ids and the system-time that the location was entered.
</dl>
<P>
Eqassemble applies up to three configurable rule sets to decide when to
release event messages. These rule sets are:

<dl>
<dt>preliminary rule:
<dd>N (=25) P phases associated with the event. At Menlo Park,
	this is used to publish a preliminary location (with no magnitude) for
	an event of potential interest to the public. This event message is
	assigned version 0.
<dt>rapid rule:
<dd>release the event message N (=90) seconds after either origin time
	or detection time, provided there are at least M (=5) P phases
	associated with the event. This message is used in CISN to initiate Ml
	calculations. The waiting time is to allow sufficient waveforms to be
	available to compute local magnitude as rapidly as feasible. This
	event message is assigned version 1.
<dt>final rule:
<dd>release the event message N (=60) seconds after binder has stopped
	updating the solution, provided there are M (=4) associated P
	phases. In addition, eqassemble can optionally wait for the
	TYPE_CODA_SCNL messages for this event. If eqassemble is configured to
	wait for codas, it will wait until coda messages are received for all
	associated picks; but not more that 150 seconds. The 150 second wait
	duration is not configurable, since it is based on the 144 second coda
	time of pick_ew. This event message is assigned version 2.
<P>
	If eqassemble is configured not to wait for codas, then the event
	message produced by eqassemble will contain no coda durations. This
	option is intended for networks which do not want to produce duration
	magnitudes with the Earthworm sausage.
</dl>
<P>
Occasionally, binder will decide to cancel event on which it has been working,
It indicates this by reducing the number of associated picks to zero. If
eqassemble sees this happen after it has released any version of the event
message, it will issue a TYPE_CANCELEVENT message.
<P>
Occasionally, eqassemble will receive more TYPE_QUAKE2K and TYPE_LINK
message for a given event id after it has finalized that event. Eqassemble
will note these messages in its log file, but it will never send another
TYPE_EVENT2K message thru the mega-module for that event id.
