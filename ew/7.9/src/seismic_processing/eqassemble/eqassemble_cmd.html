<!-- Paragraph "On startup, xxxx reads the..." -->
On startup, eqassemble reads the configuration file named on the
command-line. Commands in this file set up all parameters used in making
earthquake notifications. In the control file, lines may begin with a
valid eqassemble command (listed below) or with one of 2 special characters:
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>

    #  marks the line as a comment (example: # This is a comment).

    @  allows control files to be nested; one control file can be
       accessed from another with the command "@" followed by
       a string representing the path name of the next control file
       (example: @model.d).

</BLOCKQUOTE></PRE>
Command names must be typed in the control file exactly as shown in this
document (upper/lower case matters!).

# Set pick/quake FIFO lengths (must be >= binder's fifo lengths)
#---------------------------------------------------------------
 pick_fifo_length  1000  # optional: default = 1000
 quake_fifo_length  100  # optional: default = 100

# Control how/when events are reported
#-------------------------------------

                    # non-zero = do send S-phases to next process
 HypCheckInterval  5.0	# interval (sec) at which to check all hypocenters
                    #   to see if it's time to report an event


# Rules for reporting events
#---------------------------
# At least one of these rules must be given; there are no defaults
# Syntax:
#	PrelimRule numPhases
#		Event2K message released with version 0 when event has
#		<numPhases> P phases associated.
#	RapidRule numPhases seconds SinceOrigin
#     or
#	RapidRule numPhases seconds SinceDetection
#		Event2K message released with version 1 <seconds> since
#		origin or detection time provided <numPhases> P phases
#		associated.
#	FinalRule numPhases seconds [WaitForCodas]
#		Event2K message released with version 2 when solution has
#		been stable for <seconds>, has <numPhases> P phases associated,
#		and optionally after codas have arrived.
# Codas are reported only with the FinalRule and only if the
# WaitForCodas flag is included in the FinalRule command
#
PrelimRule    25
RapidRule     5 30 SinceDetection
FinalRule     4 60 WaitForCodas

# If we are going to wait for codas, and some picks are imported from
# other Earthworm Installations, eqassemble can optionally wait for codas
# from those other installations with one or more of:
# CodaFromInst InstId
# You do not need to list your own Inst ID.
# CodaFromInst is ignored if the FinalRule does not wait for codas.
CodaFromInst INST_MENLO

# DataSrc: single character to indicate the source of phase data
DataSrc    W

# MaxPhasesPerEq: restrict the number of phases to be reported for
# the RapidRule and FinalRule to this value. Cannot be set greater than
# the Earthworm limit of 250, which is also the default for this parameter
MaxPhasesPerEq 250

# Control debugging info to log
#------------------------------
 WaifTolerance   4.0  # tolerance (sec) for noting waif picks for
		      #   in log file. (optional: default = 4.0)

<P>
In the following section, all configuration file commands are listed
in alphabetical order.  Listed along with the command (bold-type) are
its arguments (in red), the name of the subroutine that processes the
command, and the function within the module that the command influences.
A detailed description of the command and is also given.  Default values

<BLOCKQUOTE> <!-- command description goes here -->
Identify from which installations (by <font color=red>inst_id</font>)
eqassemble should wait for coda messages for the <A HREF="#FinalRule">FinalRule</A>, other than the local inst_id. This optional command is only useful if the
FinalRule is turned on and configured to WaitForCodas. If you are importing
TYPE_PICK_SCNL and TYPE_CODA_SCNL messages from other Earthworm installations,
then you may want eqassemble to wait for those codas. But if another Earthworm
installation was sending only TYPE_PICK_SCNL messages, then you would not want
eqassemble to wait for those TYPE_CODA_SCNL messages. You can list as many <B>
CodaFromInst</B> as needed. But you do not need to list your own inst_id.

The final TYPE_EVENT2K message will be released after binder has not changed
the solution (no TYPE_QUAKE2K messages) in <font color=red>Msec</font> seconds,
provided there are at least <font color=red>Np</font> P phases associated
with the event. If the optional string <font color=red>WaitForCodas</font> is
included in the FinalRule command, eqassemble will wait up to 150 seconds after
a phase arrival until the corresponding coda message is received. Normally the
extra wait for codas applies only to TYPE_CODA_SCNL messages from the local
inst_id. Use the <A HREF="#CodaFromInst">CodaFromInst</A> command to tell
eqassemble to wait for codas from other Earthworm installations.
<p>
The final TYPE_EVENT2K message is assigned version number 2. This version
number will show up
in the hypoinverse archive message produced by hyp2000_mgr, usually the last
program in the "sausage".
<p>
The <B>FinalRule</B> command is optional. If it is absent, the final ruleset
will not be applied and no version 2 event messages will be released from
eqassemble. However, you must have at least one of <A

Sets the command to which eqassemble will pipe a "binder-finalized" event
for the next step in earthquake processing.  Blank spaces are allowed
in <font color=red>cmdstring</font> as long as the entire command is enclosed
in double-quotes.
<p>
Note that on unix-like systems, you can precede the command with "exec". This
will cause the shell which invokes the command to be replaced by the command
instead of remaining as the command's parent process. Using this trick in
the PipeTo command in each of the sausage sub-programs will save you from
keeping several shell instances for no useful purpose.

When eqassemble is preparing to release a final (version 2) TYPE_EVENT2K
message, it logs information about phases associated with the event, and about
phases not associated with this event but which have "small" travel time
residuals relative to this event. This command gives the largest absolute
value residual as <font color=red>N</font> seconds. See <A

<H2>4.  DESCRIPTION OF EQASSEMBLE'S LOG FILE</H2>

<PRE>

Eqassemble writes a number of different lines of information to its log file
when an event is first detected, as binder evolves its location, and when
eqassemble releases the various versions of TYPE_EVENT2K message or the
TYPE_CANCELEVENT messages. This section describes the log file entries.

Every time eqassemble grabs a TYPE_QUAKE2K message from the shared memory
ring, it writes a line to its log file.  It's sort of giving you a time-stamped
summary of binder's output.  Here are some example lines and what they contain:

 146 56.00:70131066  146 41.07  38.3540 -122.7992 18.00 0.00  0.0  0.0   0  5
 146 56.00:70131066  146 39.49  38.2606 -122.7295 25.50 0.18 19.7 54.7 282  5
 146 56.00:70131066  146 39.48  38.2603 -122.7294 25.50 0.27 19.8 54.0 282  6

field  columns   Description
       (approx)
1,2      1-10    System time (hrmn sec) at which this TYPE_QUAKE2K message
                 was received.
 3      12-19    Binder's event id.
4,5     21-30    hrmn sec of event origin time
 6      32-39    latitude
 7      41-49    longitude
 8      50-55    depth
 9      56-60    rms
10      61-65    dmin: distance to nearest station
11      66-70    ravg: average epicentral distance of all associated stations
12      72-74    maximum azimuthal gap
13      75-77    total # picks associated with this event.

You'll notice that the first line has zero's for rms, dmin, ravg, and gap.
This is binder's initial stack location for the event.
The subsequent locations for the event come from binder's simple L1 locator.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The log entries for an event meeting the rapid rule set produces log entries
similar to these:

The first line tells you that a rapid message is being released
Field    Description
 1,2     system time (hrmn sec) when the event met the "rapid" ruleset
  3      binder's event id,
  5      a string that contains the event origin time (yyyymmddhhmm_xx)
         where xx is the last 2 digits of the event id.

The second line is a summary line with:
Field    Description

 2,3,4   origin time,
  5      latitude,
  6      longitude,

  8      rms,
  9      dmin,
 10      ravg,
 11      gap,
 12      # associated phases.

The remaining lines describe the phases associated with the event:
    columns  Description
       1-10  station (site,net,component),
      12-21  arrival time,
      31-32  phase that binder called it,
         33  polarity,
         34  pick quality (0-4),
      35-40  epicentral distance, and
      41-47  traveltime residual (sec).
      49-?   optional comment (only in final event report)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When eqassemble decides that binder is finished with an event, you'll see
a set of lines that look something like this:

The format is the same as for the preliminary and rapid event reports, except
that the phase lines may have entries in the comment field here.
These are the lines that have either "#xxxx" (an event id) or "WAIF" written
after the residual in the optional comment field.  These are phases that
eqassemble thought could possibly have been associated with this event, but
that weren't.  If the comment is "#xxxx" then that phase is actually
associated with a different event (whose id is xxxx).  If the comment is
"WAIF" then the phase is not associated at all.

<H2>5.  THE "MEGA-MODULE" WHICH BEGINS WITH EQASSEMBLE</H2>
<P>
The eqassemble "mega-module" is a chain of processes that produces
final earthquake locations for the Earthworm system.   Only eqassemble, the first link in the mega-module, is listed
in startstop's configuration file to be started by startstop.  Eqassemble
then starts the next process, specified in its "PipeTo" command, and
communicates with it via a pipe.
Each newly created process starts the next link in the same way.
From startstop's point of view, the whole mega-module inherits the name
of the first link (eqassemble) and that's the only name it displays.
From statmgr's point of view, all processes
within the mega-module share one module id, one heartbeat, and one
descriptor file.  However, each process has its own configuration file
and its own log file.
<P>
Note that Earthworm logo of heartbeat and error messages from all the
"mega-module" processes is set by hyp2000_mgr, not by eqassemble or any other
sausage process.
<P>
As of 11 February 2007, the eqassemble mega-module consists of
the following "links":
<PRE>
  SUB-MODULE    INPUT FROM   		  	OUTPUT TO
  ----------	----------		  	---------
  eqassemble 	shared memory (PICK_RING)	pipe to eqbuf
  eqbuf   	stdin (pipe from eqassemble)   	pipe to eqcoda
  eqcoda	stdin (pipe from eqbuf)    	pipe to eqverify
  eqverify	stdin (pipe from eqcoda)   	pipe to hyp2000_mgr
  hyp2000_mgr	stdin (pipe from eqverify)	shared memory (HYPO_RING)

</PRE>

<H3>Inter-link (Intra-mega-module) Communication:</H3>

All messages are passed between the processes of the mega-module
via pipes.  The pipe communications are encapsulated in a set of routines containing
the peculiarities of the operating system.  Messages, with types defined
in earthworm.d, are sent from one link to the next, in one direction only!
If a process
doesn't need to do anything with a given message type, it just pipes it
along to the next link.  The current pipe routines (in pipe.c) are:
<PRE>
  pipe_init   	starts up the next "link", replacing its stdin with
		a pipe from the "parent" program.
  pipe_put	writes a message of a given type to the pipe.
  pipe_get	gets the next message from the pipe.
  pipe_close    closes the pipe.

</PRE>

<H3>Heartbeats:</H3>
The mega-module has one module-id and one heartbeat.  The heartbeat
initiates at the first link (eqassemble), is piped through all the links, and is
deposited into shared memory by the last link (in this case, hyp2000_mgr).
If any of the links dies,
no heartbeat will be seen by statmgr and it will complain appropriately.

<H3>Error Messages:</H3>
Since the whole mega-module has only one module-id, the sub-modules need
to share the complete set of error numbers within a common descriptor file.
Each link is assigned a
block of error numbers to use for its complaints.  Each link passes along
any error messages it reads from the pipe.  The last link puts all error
messages into shared memory where they are available to statmgr.
Statmgr reads one descriptor file for the mega-module.

<H3>Final Output from Mega-module:</H3>
The last link in the mega-module, hyp2000_mgr, deposits heartbeats, error
messages, and event messages
(that look like hypoinverse archive files) onto shared memory where any
other Earthworm module can find them.
