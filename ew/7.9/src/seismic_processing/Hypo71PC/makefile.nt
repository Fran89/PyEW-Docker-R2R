#          Nmake file for stand-alone version of Hypo71PC
#                         Windows NT version
#
#          THIS MAKEFILE HAS NOT BEEN SUCCESSFULLY RUN ON WINDOWS
#
#          The original Hypo71 will compile on Windows 
#          http://jclahr.com/science/software/hypo71/
#          but this one with the additional work isn't known to work yet
#          outside of Linux.
#
#          If you manage to get this compile working, please let the
#          Earthworm development team know, so we can include your fix
#          for the next release!
#
#  Compiling and linking is accomplished on one line.
#  This allows the compiler to intercompare the source files,
#  and catch some additional errors.
