<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Gmew Overview</H1>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>Localmag is an Earthworm module for computing ground-motion
parameters: peak ground acceleration, velocity and displayment, plus spectral
response values.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>When in starts up, gmew connects to a transport ring and reads
HYP2000_ARC messages, produced by hypoinverse. Gmew also uses the transport
ring for sending strong-motion messages, as well as heartbeat and status
messages. Gmew reads the summary line of the HYP2000_ARC message, starts
collecting trace data from one or more wave_servers, and processes the data
for that event. Once the processing (described below) is completed, the gmew
module becomes dormant, waiting for the next event to arrive and beating its
heart at the specified interval.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>Gmew prepares the new data for processing
by checking for gaps and removing the mean. Then gmew transforms the trace
data into the frequency domain using an FFT (fast fourier tranform). A cosine
taper is applied to remove the lowest and highest frequency components. The
default values for the cosine taper ranges are 0.05 to 0.1 Hz at the low end
and 45% to 50% of samplerate at the high end. Individual SCNs may be
configured to use other filter values if necessary. The low frequency cutoff
is essential to stabilize the displacement trace.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>The instrument response is removed, and acceleration, velocity
and displacement traces are computed. In addition, spectra response data is
computed for the three periods of 0.3 seconds, 1.0 seconds, and 3.0 seconds,
with 0.5% damping. All six of these traces are computed in the frequency
domain, since integration or differentiation are easily computed there. The
spectral response traces are computed by generating the response function for
a one degree of freedom harmonic oscillator with the specified free period and
damping. All six of these synthetic traces are then transformed back to the
time domain by an FFT that handles multiple arrays simultaneously.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>When the synthetic traces have been returned to the time domain,
the peak amplitudes are located for each trace.  The search for peak amplitude
is done within a time window related to the estimated S-phase arrival time and
specified in the configuratiion file.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>Gmew writes a TYPE_STRONGMOTIONII message for each SCN that it
processes. This message contains the PGA, PGV, PGD and spectral response
values for the SCN. In addition, the user can configure gmew to write an XML
file for the entire event. This file is in the format used by ShakeMap
(version 2) for station readings.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>Some warnings about this program: Currently gmew does not
know to wait for trace data to appear in the wave_servers. So when run as an
Earthworm module, it may not be able to obtain enough trace data for adequate
processing. You may want to run gmew manually after all the desired trace
data has accumulated in the wave_server.

<P>Gmew uses a quite a bit of CPU time, depending on the number and
duration of traces requested. If this and other CPU-intensive modules such as
localmag are running on the same machine, they will have a significant impact on
the machine load after one or more large events. Until Earthworm has some sort
of scheduling system, you may want to run these programs at reduced priority.

<P>Gmew will gradually use increasing amounts of memory. This is normal. It is
keeping information about FFT factors and trig functions, so that these do not
need to be recalculated for each trace calculation.
