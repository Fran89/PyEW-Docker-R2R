<p>eqfilterII is the so called <i> garbage rejector </i>. That is it
performs sanity and authoritative region tests to hyp2000arc, loc_global,
and/or rayloc messages found on the InRing and passes to the OutRing.
InRing and OutRing can not be the same.

<p>
All tests are optional.  If a test is not configured then it is not
performed. If a test is configured then it must pass.  Tests are tied
to inst_id.  More or less all parameters in the hypo summary card may
be tested for.  Additionally, authoritative regions may be configured.
Minimum number of coda picks greater than zero for multiple magnitudes
may also be configured.  Some tests are specific to message type and
are ignored if the message being processed is not of that type.  All
message types and tests may be configured in a single instance of eqfilterII.

<p>
INST_WILDCARD is allowed.  If wildcard is the only institute configured
for a given test then arc messages from any installation will be tested
with those parameters.  If only specific installation is configured for
a given test, then only messages from that installation will be tested
for and all others will fail.  If a specific installation is configured
for a given test and wildcard is also configured for that test, then
messages from the specific will use those parameters, and all other
non-specified installations will use the wildcard params.

<P>
On startup, eqfilterII reads the configuration file named on the command-line.  
Commands in this file set up all parameters used in testing events for passing
to the clean ring.
In the control file, lines may begin with a valid eqfilterII command (listed below)
or with one of 2 special 
characters:
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
#  marks the line as a comment (example: # This is a comment).<BR>   
@  allows control files to be nested; one control file can be 
   accessed from another with the command "@" followed by 
   a string representing the path name of the next control file 
   (example: @model.d).
</BLOCKQUOTE></PRE>
Command names must be typed in the control file exactly as shown in this
document (upper/lower case matters!).
<P>

<H2>1.  EXAMPLE CONFIGURATION FILE</H2>
<PRE>
# Configuration file for eqfilterII
#
# son of eqfilter
# now reads the following, mutually exclusive message types
#  TYPE_HYP2000ARC
#  TYPE_LOC_GLOBAL
#  TYPE_RAYLOC
#
# pick up messages of specified type, if at least 1 authoritative
# region is defined, extract the lat and lon of the location and the
# installation ID of the author of the  message. Then, using the
# authoritative region polygons, determine whether the location is
# within this installation's authoritative region. If it is not, then
# do not write the message to the OutRing, otherwise the message will
# not get written. Exclude regions are also permitted.
#
# Next, perform all the other optional tests.  If any configured tests
#   fail, do not write message to OutRing.
#
# Except for the authreg test, WildCards are permitted.  If an event
#   logo does not have an instid contained in the list of a particular
#   parameter, then the list is checked for a WildCard.  If there is
#   a WildCard entry, the test is performed.  If WildCard is not
#   configured and the logo instid is not on the list, the message
#   will NOT be written to OutRing (but will be logged if Debut is set).
#
# All tests (including authreg) are optional.  Lack of any configured
#   tests is not tested for (we assume a reasonable level of skill).
#
#
# Note not all tests defined for each message type


LogFile 1     # 0 means don't create a disc log file. 1=> do.
              # 2 means write to module log but not to stderr/stdout

#
# AllowUndefInst - OPTIONAL
#  Applies only to authreg test.
#  If this is uncommented, the TYPE_HYP2000ARC messages with installation
#  ID not listed in any InclRegion command below will be written to the 
#  OutRing.  To prevent writing of messages with "unknown" installation
#  IDs, make sure that this options is NOT commented out.
#
AllowUndefInst

#
# List authoritative regions: at least one InclRegion keyword is required.
#  It associates an earthworm installation ID with a polygon (max 20 sides)
#  inside of which that installation is authoritative.
#    o An installation can have more than one authoritative region.
#    o A region can belong to more than one installation.
#
# The points of a polygon should be listed as if lines of the polygon
# were being drawn without lifting up the pencil, until the polygon
# is closed. Therefore, the first and the last point should be
# the same, and each two the points in between should be the ends
# of one side of the polygon.
#
# ExclRegion is optional. It allows for "holes" to be cut inside of the 
# authoritative regions defined by InclRegion option.
