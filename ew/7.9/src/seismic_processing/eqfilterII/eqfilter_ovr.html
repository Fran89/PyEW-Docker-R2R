<P>
This is the Earthworm hypocenter garbage rejector.  Eqfilter gets message type
HYP2000ARC from the InRing does some sanity checks then puts any that pass
all configured tests onto the OutRing.  InRing and OutRing can not be the
same.  All tests are optional.  If a test is not configured then it is not
performed. If a test is configured then it must pass.  Tests are tied
to inst_id.  More or less all parameters in the hypo summary card may
be tested for.  Additionally, authoritative regions may be configured.
Minimum number of coda picks greater than zero for multiple magnitudes
may also be configured.
</p>

<p>INST_WILDCARD is allowed.  If wildcard is the only installation configured
for a given test then arc messages from all installations will be tested
with those parameters.  If only a specific installation is configured for
a given test, then only messages from that installation will be tested
and all others will fail.  If a specific installation is configured
for a given test and wildcard is also configured for that test, then
messages from the specific will use those parameters, and all other
non-specified installations will use the wildcard params.
