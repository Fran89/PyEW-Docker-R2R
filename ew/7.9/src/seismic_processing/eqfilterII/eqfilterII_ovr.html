<P>
This is the Earthworm hypocenter garbage rejector.  EqfilterII is an expansion
of eqfilter and fully backward compatible to config files designed for eqfilter.
EqfilterII gets message types  LOC_GLOBAL, HYP2000ARC, and/or RAYLOC
from the InRing does some sanity checks then puts any that pass
all configured tests onto the OutRing.  InRing and OutRing can not be the
same.  Multiple message types may be configured for a single instance of eqfilterII.
All tests are optional.  Some tests are specific to a particular
message type and will be ignored if a differing message type is processed.
If a test is not configured then it is not performed. If a test is configured then it
must pass.  Most parameters in the various message types may be tested. Tests are
tied to inst_id (wild cards okay).  Additionally, authoritative regions may be configured.
Minimum number of coda picks greater than zero for multiple magnitudes
may also be configured.
</p>

<p>INST_WILDCARD is allowed.  If wildcard is the only installation configured
for a given test then arc messages from all installations will be tested
with those parameters.  If only a specific installation is configured for
a given test, then only messages from that installation will be tested
and all others will fail.  If a specific installation is configured
for a given test and wildcard is also configured for that test, then
messages from the specific will use those parameters, and all other
non-specified installations will use the wildcard params.
