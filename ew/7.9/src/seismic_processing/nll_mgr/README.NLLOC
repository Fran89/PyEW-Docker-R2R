The nll_mgr program is designed to drive Anthony Lomax's NonLinLoc locator
program. The software source for the NLLoc program is provided in the src
directory below and was last updated by Anthony on Feb 28, 2011. Please
check his website for updates:

The provision of NLLoc with EW is a convenience. Please give Anthony feedback
and any business if you want changes made to the code.
