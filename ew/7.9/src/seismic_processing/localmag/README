The is the README file for localmag, and earthworm program for
calculating local magnitudes.

See the overview and command HTML documents in the Doc directory

There are sections in the code that some day will allow connections
to the Earthworm Database. Currently, these are disabled by "#ifdef EWDB"
cpp statements. Use these to look for places where the database connections
need to be implemented. I encourage you to keep this EWDB-specific code
inside these "#ifdef EWDB" lines. That way, earthworm users who do not have
the Earthworm Database can still compile localmag.

There are also sections of the code that allow some UW-specific file
formats to be read and written. These are protected by "#ifdef UW". 
Additional files are neede to compile localmag with these UW extensions; 
they are not provided by USGS.

The end result is that the code compiles now without the EWDB or UW
sections.
