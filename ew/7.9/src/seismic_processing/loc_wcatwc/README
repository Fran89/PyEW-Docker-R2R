This is work by ISTI porting Paul Whitmore et al's ATWC EarlyBird locator
module loc_wcatwc to UNIX. This is a work in progress.

I started with the version released in the twc bundle from ATWC named:

EB_PublicRelease_V554_2011.09.28-N01.exe

No modifications to the code were made other than #ifdef _WINNT around
sections of code that were too Windows specific, related to GUI and
windows compilation linkages.

ISTI tested this on Mac OS X and it worked with a mostly stock set
of configuration files found in the EB public release bundle.

Caveat Emptor: Any use of this is at your own risk/peril and ISTI
is not responsible for how you use it. 

Acknowledgements: The authors of the original code are awesome guys 
and we are happy they are keeping things open source. Lets keep
Earthworm and Open Source moving forward.
