CarlTrig Overview</H1>

<CENTER><P><I>(last revised 17 May, 1998)</I> </P></CENTER>

<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>The pair of modules, <I>carlstatrig</I> and <I>carlsubtrig</I> implement
Carl Johnson's STA/LTA with subnet coincidence trigger on Earthworm. This
trigger can be tuned to be a fairly sensitive detection algorithm that
has rather weak discrimination between noise and seismic signals. </P>

<P> As the names imply, <I>carlstatrig</I> performs trigger calculations
for one or more stations, while <I>carlsubtrig</I> does the subnet and
network trigger logic. <I>Carlstatrig</I> writes a TYPE_CARLSTATRIG message
for each station that triggers; these messages are placed on an earthworm
transport ring. <I>Carlsubtrig</I> reads these station trigger messages
from the transport ring. Thus there can be more than one <I>carlstatrig</I>
or <I>carlsubtrig</I> module running at once. Using export_generic/import_generic,
station trigger messages can be exchanged between different computers and
installations, allowing great flexibility in the configuration. Provision
is made for slow delivery of station trigger messages. The subnet calculations
are performed after a configurable latency period has elapsed. </P>

<P> <I>Carlsubtrig</I> writes a TRIGLIST message to a transport ring. Among
other uses, this message is intended to be used for retrieving trace data
from one or more <I>wave_serverV</I> modules. <I>Dbtracesave</I> (in development)
is an example of such an application. The TRIGLIST message gives event
start time and duration, as well as a list of stations and the times they
triggered. In addition to the TRIGLIST messages <I>carlsubtrig</I> can
write a psudo-pickfile in UW-pickfile format which contains the times (resolution
of one second) of each station trigger as a psudo P-time and the event
duration. This file is used at UW with the program, <I>earth2uw</I> to
extract a UW2 waveform file from <I>wave_serverV</I> for use in manual
review and analysis. </P>

<H2>Carlstatrig</H2>

<P>The station trigger algorithm works as follows. For each configured
station, the short-term (1 second) average of the trace is calculated.
An 8 second average of this STA is taken to get the long-term average (LTA).
In addition to these two `straight' averages, there are corresponding rectified
averages. The short-term rectified average (STAR) is taken from the absolute
value of the difference between the trace and the LTA, averaged for one
second. The long-term rectified average (LTAR) is the 8 second average
of STAR. </P>

<P> These four averages are combined to determine the station trigger status,
using a modified version of Carl Johnson's magic formula: </P>

<P> </P>

<PRE>        <I>eta</I> = STAR - Ratio * LTAR - | STA - LTA | - Quiet</PRE>

<P>In its original form this calculation was done in integer arithmetic.
In that case, the value of Ratio was in the form Enumer / Edenom. The current
calculations are performed in floating-point arithmetic. This obviates
the need for some subtle adjustments used in the earlier code, and seems
to make the algorithm more sensitive. </P>

<P> If <I>eta</I> is greater than 0.0, the station is considered triggered,
the trigger turns off when eta &lt;= 0.0. When the station trigger turns
on, one CARLSTATRIG message is sent to the transport ring. When the station
trigger turns off, another trigger message is sent. This provides some
redundancy in case one of these messages does not get delivered to <I>carlsubtrig</I>.
If the `OFF' message is never received, <I>carlsubtrig</I> assumes a (configurable)
maximum duration for the station trigger. </P>

<H2>Carlsubtrig</H2>

<P>As mentioned above, <I>carlsubtrig</I> reads CARLSTATRIG messages from
one or more <I>carlstatrig</I> modules and performs the subnet trigger
logic. One of the configuration files is a list of `subnets' and the stations
assigned to each. The list also includes the number of stations required
to trigger each subnet. </P>

<P> As station trigger messages are received by <I>carlsubtrig</I>, they
are stored in queues by station. <I>Carlsubtrig</I> maintains an internal
clock which is set a fixed number of seconds (the latency period) behind
wall-clock (real) time. This latency period allows for delayed delivery
of station trigger messages. <I>Carlsubtrig</I> uses this internal clock
to compare to station trigger times. Once the station trigger-on or -off
time is later than the internal clock time, this trigger status change
is noticed by <I>carlsubtrig</I>. </P>

<P> After the station trigger off time has expired, the station is still
considered triggered for an additional <I>TimeToLive</I> (configurable).
This feature is to allow for the difference in travel times of the P-wave
to each of the stations in a subnet. The idea is that for a subnet to trigger
for an event, some minimum (configurable) number of its station triggers
must be on at the same time. The <I>TimeToLive</I> parameter is set to
provide this coincidence within a subnet. </P>

<P> When any one subnet is triggered, the network becomes triggered and
an event (TRIGLIST) message will eventually be released and optionally.
The duration of the network trigger depends on the maximum number of subnets
that trigger, up to a configured maximum trigger length. When the network
trigger finally expires, then the TRIGLIST message is sent to the transport
ring. All the subnets are reset and the module waits for the next event.
</P>

<H2>Subnet configuration issues</H2>

<P>In any given network there will usually be several subnets defined with
many stations appearing in different subnets. Stations which are geographically
near each other should be grouped in a subnet and these groups should be
overlapping in such a way that most stations are part of two or three subnets.
A particularly low-noise station might be included in any subnet more than
once to let it have a much stronger influence in causing a trigger. If
telemetry noise is common to several stations it is wise to try and divide
these stations over several subnets so that that the coincidence of telemetry
glitches are less likely to cause a trigger. Typical subnets might have
from 5 to 20 stations and require from 3 to 5 station triggers to cause
an event trigger. </P>
