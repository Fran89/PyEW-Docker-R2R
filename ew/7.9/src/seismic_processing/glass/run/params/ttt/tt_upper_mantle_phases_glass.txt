#entry weights:
# AssocStrength  - strength with which this phase binds to an Event
# LocWeight      - weight with which this phase affects origin location
# MagThresh      - minimum magnitude of quake which this phase can
                   be associated with.
				   (Some distant/special phases come in very well with
				    larger quakes, but you don't want them wrongly assoc.
					with a small quake)
# ResWinWidth - width of residual window (3 sigma) for the phase.
