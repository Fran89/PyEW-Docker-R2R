  Do one-time(I think) initialization for each module

ISolve
  Get a pointer to Solve

ITravelTime
  Get a pointer to the Travel Time interface.
  (Note*: both EarthMod and TravelTime reply to the

  Log a message via Earthworm module that "Station site not found."

LogFile
  CARL Unused
	Log a message to the debug utility (In EarthwormMod)

  Log Module name to Debug, lookup moduleID from module name

MsgSize
  CARL Unused
	Log "MsgSize" to the debug utility (In EarthwormMod) 

NEIC
  CARL Unused
  (PDE Module) Load a catalog file, convert to internal "QUAKE2K" messages.

NetFind
  Get Station (lat/lon/elev) information from S code (S only not SCNL)

NetLoad
  CARL Unused
  Load station from "earthworm" format file (only reads S not SCNL)

NoFlushInput  (EarthwormMod)
  CARL Unused
  Sets a bFlush flag to false (presumably don't flush EW ring on startup)

PDE
  CARL Unused
  Opens a file in read-only text mode, sets state to PDE
	Appears to trigger a conversion from that file to a Quake2K internal
	message with PICK2K internal messages.


PICK2K
  Create an internal PICK to pass from Earthworm or PDE to Glass

QUAKE2K
  Create an internal QUAKE to pass from PDE to Glass

RingIn
  CARL Unused
  Attach to a given Earthworm Ring for input

RingOut
  CARL Unused
  Attach to a given Earthworm Ring for input

sphere
  CARL Unused
  GlassMod:  hardcode some sphere settings and calculate
	their intersection.  ????

ShutDown
  ShutDown  (A default message type)
	Message to terminate sent out to all modules from Earthworm module
	 or config file reader.

SolveTest
  CARL Unused
  Send out an ISolve message, and see if you get a ISolve pointer back.

SpockReport
  CARL Unused
	Create a CSpock and initialize it.  Use it to dump a report after
	an association.  CSpock appears to dump technical Associator parameters.

T
  CARL Unused
  Earth Module handles it (looks like a traveltime lookup), but does not
	return true after handling it. Looks like a bug.

World
  CARL Unused
  Load the Base BitMap of the world for Grok display.
