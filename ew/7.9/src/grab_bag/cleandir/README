THIS IS A HYDRA MODIFIED VERSION OF CLEANDIR:

Notes from John Patton:

This program is a rewrite of the old Menlo cleandir. Cleandir runs as a Windows service (as opposed to running as a Windows Scheduled Task) and monitors the directories specified in the configuration file.  The criteria for deletion are as follows: If any file has a modification date/time older than the age specified in the configuration file, that file is deleted.  

cleandir: Utility to erase files with old modification times in
          specified directory.
