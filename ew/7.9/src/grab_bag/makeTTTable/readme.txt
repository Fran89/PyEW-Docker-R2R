This directory contains the Ray Buland travel time calculator. 

It's Solaris-specific Fortran code. 

The main program accepts command-line input specifying the resolution and range of the table. The output is an ascii file. The phases listed in the file are as per Harley's requirements for getting the time interval of interest.

Such tables are currently used by archiving/usnsn_loc2trig and oracle/apps/src/arc2trigII.
