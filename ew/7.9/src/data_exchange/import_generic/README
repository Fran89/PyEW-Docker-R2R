import_ack can replace import_generic as it can self
detect whether the importer is one that supports _ack
or not. From 7.4 on out, import_generic will no longer
be compiled and it may disappear after that.

For backward compatibilities sake, we will copy or
link the import_ack executable to import_generic.
