slink2ew is a SeedLink client module for Earthworm.<br>
<br>
The SeedLink protocol can be summarized as a simple negotiation scheme
followed by the streaming of data packets from the server.&nbsp;
SeedLink packets are composed of a small header followed by a 512-byte
Mini-SEED record (data only SEED).&nbsp; The negotiation phase allows
the client to request only specified data types from the server for
each data stream.&nbsp; A data stream is defined by a network and
station code pair.<br>
<br>
By utilizing sequence numbers for each packet in a data stream the
SeedLink protocol allows for connections to be resumed, eliminating
most data gaps.&nbsp; The ability to resume data streams is primarily
dependant on how much data, time-wise, the remote SeedLink has in it's
buffer.<br>
<br>
The protocol allows for two different modes of data transmission,
uni-station and multi-station modes.&nbsp; Uni-station mode operates
by transmitting a single data stream (data from a single station)
through one network connection.&nbsp; In this mode the data stream
does not need to be specified by the client as it is implied by the
internet address and port.&nbsp; Multi-station mode operates by
transmitting multiplexed data streams (data from multiple stations)
through a single network connection.<br>
<br>
The maxium size of the TRACEBUF2 messages created by slink2ew is
limited to the maximum number of samples (using Steim2 compression)
that can fit into a 512-byte Mini-SEED record (721 samples = 2884
bytes) plus the size of the TRACEBUF2 header (64 bytes).  So 2948 bytes
is a good estimate of the maximum size of TRACEBUF2 messages created by
slink2ew.<br>
