2013.285: 1.2
	- Redirect libmseed and libdali logging to the Earthworm logit facility
	so that messages generated by those libraries go to the correct log file.

2013.284: 1.1
	- Add signal handling for non-Windows platforms.  This allows clean
	shutdown from SIGTERM in addition to the standard RING message
	termination.  By blocking SIGPIPE, the logic to reconnect to the
	ringserver when needed is now functional.

2013.274: 1.0
	- Add code to maintain the time base of internal data buffers according
	to the start time of received tracebufs.  This avoids accumulating 
	timing imperfections of the incoming data and means any significant
	timing imperfections are more accuratley represented by the output stream.
	- Include blockette 1001 in generated miniSEED records for microsecond
	resolution time stamps.

2013.267:
	- Add number of messages queue'd to log message about the queue
	being lapped.
	- Change QueueSize in included ew2ringserver.d from 400 to 1000.

2013.263: 0.3
	- Fix handling of tracebufs that need to be byte swapped. 
	- Add Int32Encoding parameter to specify miniSEED encoding for 32-bit 
	integer sample data, default is STEIM2 compression.

2013.260: 0.2
	- Convert 16-bit integer data to 32-bit integer data, this allows using
	STEIM1 compression and for creating broadly supported miniSEED.
	- Change encoding for 32-bit integers to STEIM1 (from STEIM2) for the 
	most general case, which can include spikes, etc.
	- Finish support for 64-bit float sample data.  Remains untested!
	- Report original tracebuf datatype (before swapping to local byte order)
	in verbose output.
	- Fix logging message reporting unsupported data types.
	- Update libdali to 1.6.

2013.166: 0.1
	- Initial release.
