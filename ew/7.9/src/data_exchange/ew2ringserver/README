Read TRACEBUF and/or MSEED messages from an Earthworm ring, create
512-byte miniSEED records and forward them to a DataLink server, aka
ringserver.

See the instructions in HowTo-EW-SeedLink.txt regarding how to set up a
SeedLink server for data in an Earthworm system.


To build this module the Earthworm headers and libraries must be
available and the makefiles expect a configured Earthworm environment.

For example, if your Earthworm headers and libraries are in
/opt/earthworm/earthworm-src/ you can setup a shell with by typing:

$ source /opt/earthworm/earthworm-src/environment/ew_macosx_intel.sh

(subsitituting your path and architecture-dependent script)

Then you can compile the module like this (assuing you have installed
the appropriate development tools):

$ make -f makefile.unix
