Ew2liss Overview</H1>

<CENTER><P><I>(last revised 4 March, 2000)</I> </P></CENTER>

Ew2liss is the Earthworm module for serving Earthworm trace data in LISS
(<A HREF="http://www.liss.org">Live Internet Seismic Server</A>) format. The LISS is a
very simple service that provides trace data in miniSEED format in near-real-time
over the Internet. The ew2liss module will convert selected SCNs (station-component-network)
of trace data from an Earthworm transport ring, convert that data to miniSEED format,
and serve the data to a single LISS client (such as <A HREF="liss2ew_ovr.html">liss2ew</A>)
over a TCP/IP network connection.
 <P>
One LISS normally has data for a single station. One or more components are sent
together in the data stream. In some cases, one component is provided in more than
one sample-rate. The `location code' is used in this case to label the different kinds
of data. Note that nothing prevents ew2liss from handling SCNs from many stations except
this LISS convention. It may be that ew2liss and liss2ew could be used to exchange data
between Earthworm installations. Since LISS uses Steim-2 compression, this format should
use less network bandwidth than Earthworm's export_scn/import pair. Performing the compression
and decompression will use more CPU time, however.

<CENTER><h4>A comment about timing</h4></CENTER>  
Earthworm trace data (TRACE_BUF format) includes "starttime" and "endtime" (8-byte 
floating-point numbers) to mark the start and end times of each message. It also includes
sample count (an integer) and samplerate (an 8-byte floating-point number). Frequently this
samplerate value has been set to the <B>nominal</B> sample rate; the start and end times are
assumed to be actual measured values.
<P>
The miniSEED format includes only a start time for each record. The sample rate is encoded
in the data fixed record as two two-byte integers. These two integers are treated as 
multipliers if positive, divisors if negative; this a wide range of sample rate values can be
expressed. In converting from Earthworm TRACE_BUF messages to miniSEED, errors would be
introduced if the nominal sample rate was used to set the miniSEED sample rate factors. 
Instead, a <STRONG>best</STRONG> rate is determined from the starttime, endtime, and sample
count values. Then this new sample rate is rounded to the nearest 0.0001 samples per second.
This rounded is intended to reduce the discretization introduced by the conversion to the
short integer rate factors. Finally, this new sample rate is used to set the miniSEED sample
rate factors.
