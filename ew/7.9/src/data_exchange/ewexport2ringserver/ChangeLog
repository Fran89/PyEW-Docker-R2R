	- Modified to support building and running under Windows.  For the
          Windows build it needs some of the Earthworm libraries to compile,
          but then the generated executable can be run as a stand-alone
          program.

	- Add detection of heart beat messages based on matching the type to
	TYPE_HEARTBEAT and improve logging of expected versus received heart
	beat text when they do not match.

	- Add code to maintain the time base of internal data buffers according
	to the start time of received tracebufs.  This avoids accumulating 
	timing imperfections of the incoming data and means any significant
	timing imperfections are more accuratley represented by the output stream.
	- Include blockette 1001 in generated miniSEED records for microsecond
	resolution time stamps.
	- Add -Ie option to specify miniSEED encoding for 32-bit integer sample
	data, default is STEIM2 compression.
	- Update libmseed to 2.12 (non-EW-repository release).

	- Convert 16-bit integer data to 32-bit integer data, this allows using
	STEIM1 compression and for creating broadly supported miniSEED.
	- Change encoding for 32-bit integers to STEIM1 (from STEIM2) for the 
	most general case, which can include spikes, etc.
	- Add datatype to verbose message when receiving tracebufs.
	- Update libdali to 1.6.
