ewexport2ringserver:

Consume Earthworm TRACEBUF packets from an export server, create 512-byte
miniSEED records and forward them to a DataLink server, aka ringserver.

The export_* program must be run on a host system with the appropriate data
in an Earthworm ring.  Ideally the ewexport2ringserver process is on the same
machine or the same local network as the destination ringserver.
