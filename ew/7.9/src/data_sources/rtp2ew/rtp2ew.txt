RTP2EW

This data source module is a client program to the REF TEK/Trimble RTPD data server that
accepts PASSCAL-formatted data and inputs it into Earthworm.

This binary is being updated by the REF TEK Seismic group of Trimble, Inc.  The binary
was not ready at the time of Earthworm release v7.9.  When released, the binary will be
added to the Earthworm SVN repository for download, as well as added to future
Earthworm releases.  The binary will also be available by contacting Trimble support
directly:  reftek_support@Trimble.com
