As of Earthworm 7.1, Q3302EW is entirely rewritten.  No longer based on
Mountainair, Q3302EW now utilizes the new lib330 library for communication
with the Q330.

Windows is now Supported, as is linux and Solaris.

The sample q3302ew.d contains all available options (although some are
commented out) as well as descriptions of their use.
