Earthworm Modules:<br>
Srusb2ew Overview</h1></center>

<center><i>(last revised 05 March, 2010)</i></center>

<p>

<b>Introduction</b><br><br>

srusb2ew allows the Symmetric Research USBxCH family of low cost 24
bit data acquisition systems to send data to an Earthworm system
running either Windows (WinXP/Win7) or Linux.  USBxCH models with 4
and 8 channels are supported.  Very accurate timestamping of the
acquired data results when an optional GPS antenna is used with the
USBxCH A/D.  Timestamping using the PC system time set by NTP is also
available.

<br><br>

srusb2ew reads configuration information like sampling rate and USBxCH
model from an Earthworm style .d configuration file and then opens
drivers and initializes hardware for the USBxCH and optional GPS
antenna.  Then it starts the A/D and goes into an infinite loop
acquiring data, converting it to Earthworm tracebuf2 format and
writing it out to the specified Earthworm ring.  On each pass through
the loop, it also sends a heartbeat message to the Earthworm ring.

<br><br>

In order to run srusb2ew, you need a working Earthworm system, a
USBxCH A/D board, and the USBxCH device driver and library software
that comes with the board and is also available free from the
Symmetric Research website

For accurate timing information, a GPS antenna is also recommended.


<br><br><b>Setup</b><br><br>

Follow any instructions given in the official documentation to get
Earthworm up and running.

<br><br>

The first step in adding USBxCH data is to install the USBxCH
software.  This can be done by unpacking the usbw2k.zip or usblnx.tar
file and running the included install script to copy the SR software
to the \SR\USBXCH directory.  Linux users should substitute
/usr/local/SR/USBXCH for references to the \SR\USBXCH directory.

<br><br>

You will also need to install the USBxCH device driver.  Under
Windows, this is done automatically via the Add New Hardware wizard
and Plug 'n' Play.  Under Linux, use the indriver utility the Driver
subdirectory.  See the readme file in the \SR\USBXCH\Driver or
/usr/local/SR/USBXCH/Driver directory for more information.

<br><br>

Then hook up the A/D hardware.  Make sure it is working correctly by
running the diagnostic program in the \SR\USBXCH\Utilities\Diag
directory.  The acquisition programs in the \SR\USBXCH\Scope and
\SR\USBXCH\DVM directories can also help in checking out a new
system.

<br><br>

To add an (optional but recommended) GPS antenna purchased from
Symmetric Research, plug the 2.1mm power connector into the second
2.1mm jack on the back of the USBxCH and plug the DB25 connector on to
the 25-pin Dshell digital input connector on the front right side of
the USBxCH.  Make sure it is working correctly by running the
NmeaTime program in the \SR\USBXCH\Utilities\NmeaTime directory which
shows the received NMEA strings with the GPS information.  When
satellite lock is achieved, the red led will begin blinking and the
$GPRMC string will show the letter A in the second field instead of
the letter V.

<br><br>

Once Earthworm and the USBxCH are working on their own, it's time
to get them working together.  Edit the srusb2ew.d configuration
file settings so they are appropriate for your system.

<br><br>

At this time, you will probably also want to edit some additional
Earthworm module configuration files to handle the USBxCH data that
will be coming.  This might include adding tanks for the USBxCH data
in wave_serverV.d if the data is to be saved on the same computer or
setting the USBxCH channels in export_scn.d if the data is to be
exported to another computer.

<br><br>

In the beginning, it is probably best to use two separate command
prompt windows.  In the first, run startstop to start Earthworm.  In
the second, type "srusb2ew srusb2ew.d" without the quotes
to start the USBxCH acquiring and sending data.

<br><br>

You can check the log files and run diagnostic programs like sniffring
and sniffwave to help diagnose any problems.  If something isn't going
right, it is easy to stop srusb2ew, modify its configuration file, and
restart it without having to stop the rest of Earthworm.  Once you've
got your parameters set right, then go ahead and have startstop
control srusb2ew too.


<br><br><b>Compiling</b><br><br>

srusb2ew is written in C and is compiled and linked using the standard
Earthworm makefiles such as makefile.nt.  In order to successfully
compile, access to the USBxCH system software is required.  This
software, including source, is included with every USBxCH purchase.
It is also available for free download from the Symmetric Research
website

<a href="http://www.symres.com/index.htm"

<br><br>

All Symmetric Research software, including the USBxCH system software
and srusb2ew, has been designed so a single set of source code can
service different operating systems.  This is accomplished primarily
through the use of conditional compilation which selects OS specific
code at compile time based on which SROS_xxx setting is defined.
Valid options include SROS_WIN2K (for both Windows 2000 and XP) and
SROS_LINUX.  Solaris is not available.


<br><br><b>More Info</b><br><br>

General questions about Earthworm are probably best answered by
the official Earthworm User's discussion group.  But, if you have
specific questions about srusb2ew and its configuration
parameters, please let us know at
