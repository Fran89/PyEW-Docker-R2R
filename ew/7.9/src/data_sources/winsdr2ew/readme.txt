                                            WinSDR2Ew Module

WinSDR2Ew is a EW module to import data into a ring from our WinSDR datalogger program. See
http://www.seismicnet.com/winsdr for more information. WinSDR2Ew receives the data from WinSDR
using a TCP/IP connection. The data sent out by WinSDR are 512 byte MINISEED packets. The MINISEED
library used to decode the packets can be found in the ./mseed sub-directory.
