<!-- ADD HERE: Paragraph "On startup, xxxx reads the..." -->
On startup, k2ew reads the configuration file named on the command
line. Commands in this file set all the parameters used for configuring
the Earthworm k2ew module. In the control file, lines may begin with a 
valid k2ew command (listed below) or with one of 2 special characters:

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
#  marks the line as a comment (example: # This is a comment).<BR>   
@  allows control files to be nested; one control file can be 
   accessed from another with the command "@" followed by 
   a string representing the path name of the next control file 
   (example: @model.d).
</BLOCKQUOTE></PRE>
Command names must be typed in the control file exactly as shown in this
document (upper/lower case matters!). Blank lines are also permitted in the 
control file.

<!-- ADD HERE: Paragraph "Below are the commands recognized..." -->
Below are the commands recognized by k2ew, grouped by the function 
they influence.  Some of the commands are required, as noted. They may be specified 
in any order in the control file, with the exception of the K2 communications mode settings:
these must be listed in the order shown here.

</PRE>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <!-- command description goes here -->
Sets the channel (or component) names for earthworm trace packets to the given 
<font color=red>names-list</font>. All earthworm trace packets are identified by
their station, component, and network names (SCN). K2ew obtains a station
name from the K2. (The K2 is configured separately from k2ew; see the K2 User 
Manual from Kinemetrics.) The <b>StationID</b> command may be used to set the
station name. The K2 may also have its channel (or component) names configured
in it, and these names will be used if no <b>ChannelNames</b> entries are given.
In the <font color=red>names-list</font> argument, one or more channel names are
listed, separated by spaces or commas. Each position in the list corresponds to
a serial stream in the K2. Using a comma-separated list, empty positions
may be specified (i.e.: ChannelNames HLE,,HLZ), allowing the K2-configured names
to be used on those channels. If <A HREF="#LCFlag">LCFlag</A> == 1 and no
channel names are configured in the K2 and no <b>ChannelNames</b> entries are
given then the channels will be named "C01", "C02", etc. But if <b>LCFlag</b>
== 2, then <font color=red>names-list</font> must include a name for each
channel sent from the K2 by serial stream.
<p>
The K2 does weird things with channels and serial streams if you turn off some
serial streams with the ststreams bitmap. Channels are numbered 1 - 6 (or 1-12
or 1-18 in some of the dataloggers). These numbers do not change if you turn
off acquisition using the bitmap command.
<p>
Serial streams have a separate numbering system.
<p>
Suppose you have a 6-channel instrument. And you use "bitmap 1 2 3 4 5 6" to
turn on acquisition on all channels. And suppose you have these channels named
"HHE HHN HHZ HNE HNN HNZ" in the K2 using "channel id" commands.
<p>
If you turn on all the serial streams with "sdstreams bitmap 1 2 3 4 5 6" then
the serial streams are numbered the same as the channels.
<p>
Bit if you turn off some to the serial streams, then numbers change. If you do
"sdstreams bitmap 1 2 4 6" then the numbers are:
<p>
channel    serial stream
1          1
2          2
4          3
6          4
<p>
So the serial stream numbers are always consecutive. And the channel and
location names assigned by k2ew will always be based on the serial stream
numbers. However, if no channel names are asigned in the K2 and no channel
names are configured in k2ew, then k2ew will assign channel names based on the
channel number, not the serial stream number!
<p>
To avoid this confusion, don't use the sdstreams bitmap command to turn off
channels. If you must, turn off the highest numbered channels so there isn't a
gap in the sdstreams bitmap.

Sets the time k2ew will wait for communications with the K2 to
<font color=red>N</font> milliseconds. If nothing is heard from
the K2 in this interval and the 'DontQuit' flag is not enabled
then 'k2ew' will terminate. If a <A HREF="#RestartFile">RestartFile</A>

restart so that it can attempt to resume the data stream when k2ew
is restarted, such as by statmgr.
<p>
Note that when a TCP-to-serial connection is used, a <b>CommTimeout</b>
value of 10000 or larger may be needed to allow enough time for K2

are injected into the WAVE_RING specified by RingName. The TYPE_K2INFO packets must
be described as a local message in the earthworm.d file. These new messages are
picked up by a SeisNetWatch agent known as the k2ewagent. The k2ewagent will report

<BLOCKQUOTE> <!-- command description goes here -->
Sets the maximum acceptable age of the <A HREF="#RestartFile">restart file</A>
to <font color=red>N</font> seconds. When k2ew starts up, it reads the restart
file if it exists. If the restart file is younger than this limit, k2ew will
attempt to resume stream data from the K2 at the last packet k2ew sent before 
last shut down. This will allow the trace data from this K2 to be sent to
earthworm in time-order, though it will be late in arriving at the earthworm
transport <A HREF="#RingName">ring</A>. <B>MaxRestartAge</B> should be less 
than <A HREF="#WaitTime">WaitTime</A>.
For this restart feature to work, the K2 stream
packet sequence number must not have been reset since k2ew last wrote the
restart file.
<P>
Because of limitations in the K2, it is recommended that this value be limited
to about 120 seconds. When trying to recover from longer restarts, the K2 may 
not be able to keep up with its processing. The result will be gaps in the 
trace data with no accompanying gaps in packet sequence numbers.

If present, this command enables reporting of "loss of external power" alarm.
The K2 reports battery voltage in its status message. When external power is
provided, the K2 reports battery voltage as zero. Since a real battery 
voltage of zero would not let the K2 do anything, this is reasonable. When
the K2 first reports battery voltage as non-zero (indicating external power
has been lost) k2ew will report this fact if this command is present. This
command applies to both internal and external batteries. But since the K2
does not normally have external power (from a 110 VAC power adapter) while
using an external battery, this command should not be used when using an 
external battery. Any provision for charging an external battery is separate
from the K2 and would not be monitored by k2ew.

this file contains the wrong station name, then the trace data will be labeled
