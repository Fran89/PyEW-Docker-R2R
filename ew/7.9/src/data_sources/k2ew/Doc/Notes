1. MSS100: To do initial setup, follow directions in Installation Guide,
   section 3.1. I think that section 3.1.1 (Using EZWebCon) is the
   easiest. Then set parameters using the file mss.cmd (in this directory) as
   a guide.

2. Make sure serial port settings on MSS match those on the K2. When the K2 is
   first powered up, the number of LEDs lighted on the front panel matrix
   tells the baud rate:
       LEDs  Baud
         1   1200 (baud or error)
         2   2400
         3   4800
         4   9600
         5   19200 (default)
         6   38400
         7   57600
         8   115200
    Set the MSS to match this baud rate, 8 data bits, no parity, one stop bit
   (8-n-1). This should allow you to communicate with the K2 via the
   MSS100. Telnet to port 3001 on the MSS to make the connection to the K2.
   Once you have communication with the K2, you can change the baud rates on
   the K2 and then the MSS to what you want. 19200 is the minimum you will
   want.
