This is my latest version of k2ew. It comes on serveral flavors. On Solaris
there is k2ew_tcp (for TCP comms) and k2ew_tty (for serial comms). On
WindowsNT, there is k2ew_com (for COM port) and k2ew_tcp (for TCP comms.)
The config files for both TCP flavors are the same; the other two flavors
each have their own config files.

Important changes in this version (7/28/2000):
Moved heartbeats to a separate thread: this should help get heartbeats out
when k2ew is being delayed reading from COM or socket ports.

Added DontQuit flag: if set, k2ew will not quit on timeouts but will keep
trying. 

Also, the HTML files in the Doc directory have been updated.

See the ChangeLog for a list of code changes in k2ew.
