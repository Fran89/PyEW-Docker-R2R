<P>
q2ew is a Quanterra/COMSERV data feeding program for Earthworm. The utility
was written for the Alaska Tsunami Warning Center's Quanterra Q730 digitizers,
but should work with any Quanterra digitizer that is COMSERV compatible.
COMSERV is a software freeware 
product developed by Quanterra and other Quanterra users. It is a 
middleware software layer
between the digitizer and the data acquisition software (clients). 
In short, COMSERV insulates the
developer/user from changes to the QSL communications protocol and acts as a
multithreaded switch for client processes to access data from the digitizers.
<P>
COMSERV must be configured on the same host as the Earthworm system in order
for this program to work.   Berkeley is the ftp repository for the 
<A HREF="ftp://quake.geo.berkeley.edu/pub/quanterra/"> COMSERV software.</A>
Please refer to the COMSERV documentation on how to correctly install and
configure this system.
<P>
q2ew is designed as a multi-threaded program. The main thread loops polling
the COMSERV shared memory region, using COMSERV cs_scan() calls, for new 
packets arriving from digitizers. Once data arrives, the main thread converts
the data into an earthworm trace buffer and ships the data off to the 
earthworm transport ring. The second thread, the heartbeat,
checks that data are coming in from COMSERV in the main thread 
and issues regular 
heartbeats. Should there be a fatal problem with the COMSERV server for any of
the stations, the heartbeat thread detects this 
and a message is sent to statmgr 
and the process dies. The cs_status() call is a critical one to adjust to
fine tune the program to modify the severity of reactions to problems/changes
observed with COMSERV.
All of the fatal errors will cause q2ew to die, but some of the recoverable
errors are now set to cause q2ew to die (in particular CSCR_DIED). 
As we gain more experience with the robustness of COMSERV, 
we can adjust the recoverable errors to simply provide
status messages, but for now lets play it cautious.
