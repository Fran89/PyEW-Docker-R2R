			Comserv June 17, 1997	(csv617.lzh)

			Modified by Doug Neuhauser, doug@seismo.berkeley.edu

This directory represents the modified Comserv distrution from June 17, 1997
from Quanterra, Inc.  It has been slightly reorganized in order to make it
easier to build on a Sun environment, and to more easily add user-contributed
clients.  See the README.UCB file for more details.

To build comserv distribution:

1.  Add any additional directories for your own or user-contributed clients
to this directory.  Add the directories to the ALL list in the master
Makefile in this directory.  Ensure the Makefiles in each client directory
conforms to the definitions outlined in the master Makefile.

2.  Modify the Makefiles in each of the directories with the appropriate
definitions for your system. Sample definitions are provided for SunOS and
Solaris systems.

3.  make
	Compile all of the software, and build all executables.
4.  make install
	Install all of the executables in the bin directory.

This version of comserv is designed to work with UltraSHEAR Release
35/06-0229 or later.  It is NOT guaranteed to work with earlier versions of
UltraSHEAR due to changes in the link structure for the DA-comserv
communucations link.

Stefan Radman (radman@zamg.ac.at) is working on an X.25 interface for
comserv, and will make it available at a later date.
