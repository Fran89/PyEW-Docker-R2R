Welcome to the q2ew - Quanterra to Earthworm module.

This release was compiled  and tested on an UltraSparc1 running
Solaris 2.6 and gcc 2.8.1.

INSTALL

To build and run this module you need the following at the same
directory level:

o	Earthworm V3.X - v3.3 was used for this writing.
o 	COMSERV	971126 - comserv.971126 linked to comserv
o	Berkeley's qlib2 - qlib2 

		..../some_dir/
		    /
   ---------------------------------
  /		   /		  /
v3.3/		comserv/	qlib2/
		  /
		q2ew/

This module's directory should be in the comserv directory as this
is both a client of COMSERV and a client of Earthworm. First it
is a client of COMSERV since without it, it won't work! So, get
the latest version of comserv and link it to the directory name comserv.

GET QLIB2 and COMSERV COMPILED

This module was written using the comserv.971126 version found at
the Berkeley ftp server quake.berkeley.edu. Also found at this site
is a nice suite of quanterra/SEED parsing functions in the qlib2
library by Doug Neuhauser.

EDIT THE q2ew Makefile

Once you have a compiled version of the above utilites, in the directory
tree as described above, edit the Makefile to reflect what libraries or
conversely, what .o object files are to be included (this is simply 
commenting or uncommenting some lines that decide where and which
libs to use).

Making it under Solaris, type:

	make

	
Copy the q2ew.d and q2ew.desc files to the params directory specified
in your earthworm installation.

Copy the q2ew binary to your earthworm bin directory.

GET COMSERV RUNNING

Configure COMSERV /etc/network.ini and /etc/stations.ini files in the /etc 
directory and then build a stations.ini for each station being
served by COMSERV. Examples for the Q730 are provided in this
directory as it was setup on the ISTI network:
	
	/etc/network.ini 	-> network.ini
	/etc/stations.ini	-> stations.ini
	Q003 station.ini	-> station.ini

The station.ini file should be placed in the directories specified in
the /etc/stations.ini file.

The config.tar distribution at Berkeley really helped me get this figured
out fast. Use the examples in this distribution and Doug's excellent notes
in the config.tar to help you get COMSERV configured.
