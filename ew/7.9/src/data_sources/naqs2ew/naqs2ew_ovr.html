<P>
Naqs2ew is an interface through which waveform data collected by
the Nanometrics data acquisition software, NaqsServer, can be fed into an Earthworm system
in near-real-time.
Naqs2ew is a client of NaqsServer's "Online Data Streams" service which allows 
client programs to open a socket connection, subscribe to only the data they want, and
receive the requested data over the same socket.  The "online data streams"
protocol and data formats are described in the Nanometrics Reference Manuals.
Currently the only NaqsServer packet types that naqs2ew can process are:  channel 
list messages, decompressed data packets, compressed data packets, and error messages. 
Naqs2ew is not required to run on the same computer as NaqsServer.
<P>
Naqs2ew is a single-threaded program. After reading its configuration file,
allocating working buffers, and attaching to a transport ring, naqs2ew attempts
to open a socket connection to NaqsServer, using a timeout of CONNECT_TIMEOUT 
seconds (currently 5 s). If the connection attempt fails, naqs2ew will attempt
to connect every CONNECT_RETRY_DT seconds (currently 10 sec) forever.  Naqs2ew will 
continue beating its own heart while trying to establish a NaqsServer connection.
<p>
Once it establishs a socket connection with NaqsServer, naqs2ew initiates the
"online data streams" protocol.  It sends a "connect message," reads and logs the list of 
available channels, and requests only the channels listed in its own
configuration file.  If some channels in the configuration file are not available, 
naqs2ew logs that fact and continues.  While the socket connection remains open, 
naqs2ew reads a complete packet (blocking), converts it to one or more Earthworm TYPE_TRACEBUF2
messages, and writes the message(s) to the transport ring. Naqs2ew makes no attempt to reorder 
timeseries packets. Naqs2ew does compare each new packet's timestamp against the timestamp 
of the last data received for that channel.  If it detects a time overlap, naqs2ew will 
ignore the entire new packet. This insures that data flowing into the Earthworm system 
will be in chronological order. If naqs2ew detects a time gap, it optionally performs a 
sanity check on the packet time (see TimeJumpTolerance command). If naqs2ew determines 
that the packet time is bogus (in the future), it ignores the entire new packet.
Naqs2ew attempts to produce one-second TYPE_TRACEBUF2 messages for 
each channel, buffering any fractional seconds between packets from NaqsServer if
necessary.  Time tears between packets may cause naqs2ew to produce TYPE_TRACEBUF2 packets shorter than one-second long. 
Naqs2ew also logs any error messages it receives from NaqsServer.
After each packet is processed, naqs2ew enters its heartbeat 
function, and issues a heartbeat if its heartbeat timer has expired.  
<P>  
If naqs2ew experiences any socket errors or if NaqsServer breaks the connection, 
naqs2ew closes the socket and issues a TYPE_ERROR message stating the reason the 
connection was dropped.  It then goes back to looping on reconnection attempts. 
When the connection is reestablished, naqs2ew will issue another TYPE_ERROR message
(really an "un-error" message), stating that everything's OK again.
