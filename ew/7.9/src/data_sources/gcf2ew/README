gcf2ew is contributed to the Earthworm distributions in source code form. 

This module has only been tested on Solaris, it might work on Linux.

The gcflib toolkit from ISTI is required to compile this module and the 
latest version of that is included in the gcf sub directory included
with this contribution.  Note that gcflib is not provided in source code
form at this time. Inquire with Guralp Systems if you wish a source code
copy of gcflib. If you have problems with that, contact ISTI directly
or go use scream2ew :^)
