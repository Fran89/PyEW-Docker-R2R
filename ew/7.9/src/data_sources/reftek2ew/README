@(#)README	1.3 2015-02-20

This is the final version of the public open source version of 
reftek2ew. This is now deprecated in place of rtpd from Trimble.
Binary versions of rtpd are available with the Earthworm distribution
but the source code is not available for rtpd. 


----

In order to build this program, you need to define the following in
your earthworm.d file:

RAW_RING       - transport ring for raw packets from the RTP server
MOD_IMPORT_RTP - module id for this process
TYPE_REFTEK    - message type for raw RTP server packets

If you want to assign pin numbers, you will need to define them in a
parameter file.  See import_rtp.d for the specification syntax, and
see reftek.scnl for an example.

All dialog with the RTP server is done via the Refraction Technology
API and libraries.  You can get a copy of this toolkit from

                    ftp://ftp.reftek.com:/pub/rtp

Install the libraries and include files as per the instructions provided
with the toolkit.  You will need to specify the installation location in
your makefile.  See the comments in the makefile appropriate for your
system.
