Welcome to the geojson2ew - geoJSON to Earthworm module.

This release was compiled and tested on an system running
Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS and gcc version 4.8.2.

INSTALL

To build and run this module you need the following:

o	Earthworm - Earthworm v7.8 was used for this writing.
o 	RabbitMQ C AMQP client v0.8.0 (https://github.com/alanxz/rabbitmq-c)
o	Jansson JSON library version 2.7 (https://github.com/akheron/jansson)

The RabbitMQ C AMQP client and Jansson libraries should be built and installed using the make files provided in the libraries (“make” and “make install”.)

Note that Earthworm requires 32-bit libraries so if your system is not 32-bit then extra setup is required. For my testing on a 64-bit Linux I first built the libraries on a 32-bit system, copied the files to my 64-bit machine, modified the makefiles to include -m32 (for CFLAGS, LDFLAGS and AM_CFLAGS) and then ran “make clean”, “make” and “sudo make install”.

Note if you do not wish to use the socket version of the code only and not compile with RabbitMQ C then use the 'geojson2ew_socket' target in the makefile.
However, it is recommended that you compile the 'geojson2ew' targert with the specified RabbitMQ C library.

Making geojson2ew under Linux, type:

	make -f makefile.unix

	
Copy the geojson2ew.d and geojson2ew.desc files to the params directory specified
in your earthworm installation and modify as needed.

Add the geojson2ew module ID (MOD_GEOJSON2EW) to the earthworm configuration file (params/earthworm.d):
 Module  MOD_GEOJSON2EW     57

Copy the geojson2ew binary to your earthworm bin directory.
