ADSEND NOTES
11/1/97

adsend runs under Windows NT only.  

It uses a National Instruments DAQ board (model PCI-MIO-16E-4). 

To compile adsend, the National Instrument nidaq software must 
be installed.

Adsend must be single-threaded because national instruments 
library is single-threaded.  The functions in threads.c are 
used to defeat multi-threading.
