nmxptool Release History
#########################

* Release 2.1.2    (2015/06/26) 
    - Fixed major bug in small time drifting of packets stored in mini-SEED format.
    - Started to fix 'Ubuntu vs. gettimeofday()' issue

* Release 2.1.1    (2013/05/13) 
    - Fixed bug:
        SEED utilizes the Big Endian word order as its standard.
        In 2003, the FDSN adopted the format rule that Steim1 and Steim2
        data records are to be written with the big-endian encoding only.
        From now on, nmxptool will only create big-endian Steim[12]
        compressed mini-SEED records (thanks to C. Trabant and S. Stromme)
    - Improvement: restart connection if any data is received within 60 seconds
                   timeout = (NMXP_HIGHEST_TIMEOUT * 2)
    - News: windows binary distribution is available again.
        nmxptool has been compiled under Cygwin, it needs "cygwin1.dll".
    - Substitude makefile.ux and makefile.sol with the single makefile.unix

* Release 2.1.0    (2012/07/22) 
    - Improvement: added capability to specify the location code within the
        channel pattern declaration (options -C, -n).
    - Improvement: also on earthworm, nmxptool responds quickly to 'stopmodule'
        and 'restart' when the nanometrics server is unreachable.
    - Improvement: incremented value of NMXP_MAX_LENGTH_DATA_BUFFER.
    - Fixed minor bug: computing endtime for earthworm tracebuf.
    - Fixed minor bug: in some cases did not close .nmxpstate file.

* Release 2.0.0    (2010/10/22) 
    - Improved saving of mini-SEED files, now data samples are saved using
        the whole available space within the mini-SEED records.
    - Added capability, using libmseed, to choose mini-SEED record length (option -r).
    - Added capability, using libmseed, to choose between steim1 and steim2
        compression (option -x), and data quality indicator (option -q). (R. Racine)
    - Added feature: enabled ShortTermCompletion also in Earthworm configuration.
        (Short-Term-Completion has been implemented in NaqsServer version 2.1)
    - Added feature: within state file it is now allowed to insert white spaces,
         tabs, and comment string by '#'. (involved option -F)
    - Changed the output list of channels from NaqsServer, in order to create
         automatically a state file. (involved option -L)
    - Added signal handling to force to close a connection and open again
         without quitting the program. Only for connection in near real-time
         to NaqsServer. (Signal -USR1).
    - Fixed some memory leaks and potential other memory bugs. (R. Racine)

* Release 1.2.4    (2009/12/22) 
    - Fixed major bugs: made code thread safe substituting functions
        and removing static variables from own functions. (S. Pintore)
    - Improved saving of mini-SEED files into SDS and BUD structure,
        now it is possible to store mini-SEED in near-real-time from NaqsServer.
    - Added feature: packets converted in mini-SEED records can be directly sent
        to the Seedlink server by the function send_mseed(), in place of using
        the function send_raw_depoch(). (option -K or -k).
    - Changed SeisComP templates adding source port to the file name of channel list.
    - Added SeisComP templates for retrieving Data On Demand with minimun delay.
    - Added minor feature: declare timing_quality from the command-line. (option -Q).

* Release 1.2.3    (2009/01/15) 
    - Added feature: mini-SEED files can be saved directly within a
        SeisComP Data Structure (SDS) or Buffer of Uniform Data (BUD)
        (changed option -m, new option -o).
    - Improvement: changed HIGHEST_TIMEOUT to 30 seconds in order to
        handle the signals whenever data is not coming through.
    - Fixed bug: Windows binary distribution now contains
        "pthreadVC2.dll" that it has been compiled by MSVC++6.0

* Release 1.2.2    (2008/07/23) 
    - Added feature: channel list can be printed declaring a pattern
        to match the desired channels. (involved options -C, -l, -L)
    - Added feature: accept 'telnet' connection for monitoring data
        and diagnostic purposes. Not available on Windows yet. (option -E)
    - Improved connection management. Exit from program only on request,
        that is, receving termination signal or ew-flag-terminate.
    - Improved signal handling using safe threads.
    - Improved request of channels using a separate thread.
    - Improved printing of info about Raw Stream data buffer. (Signal -ALRM).
    - Improved function nmxp_openSocket().
    - Added 'pluginid' to prefix log messages when launched as Seedlink plug-in.
    - Fixed bug: on Solaris system set a time-out using select() and recv()
        in order to quit properly the program when any data is received.

* Release 1.2.1    (2008/03/31) 
    - Improved request of channels in order to retrieve more efficiently
        data buffered by the NaqsServer (option -F and -b).
        It allows data continuity, to the latency's cost,
        when short disconnections to the NaqsServer occur.
        Added option --mschan=mSECs/nC, short option -f.
    - Added on Windows system, computation of the packet latencies
        when timezone is different from GMT/UTC.
    - Changed 'configure' options from --with-PACKAGE to --enable-FEATURE.

        within time defined by MaxDataToRetrieve (option -A)
        and data buffered by the DataServer and NaqsServer.
    - Added support for retrieving Data-On-Demand
        with minimum delay from NaqsServer (option -T).
    - Added option "buffered time" for a single channel (options -b, -B).
    - Added ten thousandth of second in date format (option -s, -e).
    - Added check for duplication in channel pattern declaration (options -F, -C).
    - Added logging of sample values (option -G).
    - Option "interval" can be declared in minutes, hours or days (option -t).
    - Fixed major bug in DAP authentication (options -u and -p).
    - Fixed bug in packet decompression on Big-Endian architecture.
        Offset +1 count was added when x0 was greater than zero.
    - Countless minor bug fixes and improvements.

* Release 1.1.7     (2007/12/11)
    - Added support for WindowsXP and Windows2000 (compilation under MinGW).
