- INTRODUCTION

  The Nanometrics servers NaqsServer and DataServer can provide on-line access
to seismic data and state-of-health information accepting TCP/IP connections
and forwarding the requested data to each client program.  NaqsServer collates
and stores in near-real-time incoming data in ringbuffers whereas DataServer
provides data of the past stored in NaqsServer ringbuffers.  In order to
implement the Nanometrics subscription protocols, the author developed a
software consisting of a library called libnmxp and a tool called nmxptool. The
library exposes a set of documented APIs which allow to communicate with the
Nanometrics servers. The tool, based on libnmxp, allows to retrieve or monitor
real-time data and data of the past.

  nmxptool can be used in three different ways:

      * stand-alone to monitor data or save retrieved data in mini-seed records
      * launched as an Earthworm module to redirect data into the EW-rings
      * like a Seed-Link plug-in to feed the SL-server
	
  The main contribute, as regards other similar software, is the capability to
manage Raw Stream connections by buffering and sorting all received packets,
included the retransmitted ones, guaranteeing a good compromise between data
continuity and low latency. Besides, nmxptool allows to retrieve Data-On-Demand
with minimum delay after request. Software is open-source and released under
GNU Library General Public License. It has been written in C language using the
GNU Build Tools (automake, autoconf and configure script) and taking in account
the cross-platform compilation aspects, in fact, it can run on almost all the
Unix-like operating systems, Mac OS X, Windows and either 32-bit or 64-bit
architectures.

     For binary installation see section INSTALLATION BINARIES below.


- INSTALLATION

  nmxptool and libnmxp have been developed using GNU Build Tools
  (automake, autoconf and configure script) taking in account the
  POSIX Cross-Platform aspects. So you should be able to compile
  and install them everywhere you can launch the following commands:

     ./configure --enable-FEATURE1 ... VAR1=... VAR2=...
     make
     make install

  Options for nmxptool 'configure' script:

  Disabling optional Features
      --disable-libmseed      disable saving data in mini-SEED records
      --disable-ew            do not compile nmxptool as Earthworm module
      --disable-seedlink      do not compile nmxptool as Seedlink plug-in

  Some influential environment variables:
      EW_HOME     Earthworm home directory
      EW_VERSION  Earthworm version directory
      EW_PARAMS   Earthworm configuration files directory
      GLOBALFLAGS C compiler flags for Earthworm

  'configure' adds -I${EW_HOME}/${EW_VERSION}/include to CFLAGS

  Examples:

    * 'configure' tries to compile all features
          ./configure CFLAGS="-O2 -Wall -pipe -I/<anywhere>/libmseed" \
                      LDFLAGS="-L/<anywhere>/libmseed"

    * Enable only Earthworm feature and set related variables
          ./configure --disable-libmseed --disable-seedlink \
                      CFLAGS="-O2 -Wall -pipe" \
                      EW_HOME="/home/ew" \
                      EW_VERSION="v7.2" \
                      EW_PARAMS="${EW_HOME}/${EW_VERSION}/params" \
                      GLOBALFLAGS="-D_SPARC -D_SOLARIS"

                           or, for example
                      GLOBALFLAGS="-m32 -Dlinux -D__i386 -D_LINUX -D_INTEL -D_USE_SCHED  -D_USE_PTHREADS -D_USE_TERMIOS"
                      GLOBALFLAGS="-D_MACOSX -D_INTEL -D_USE_PTHREADS -D_USE_SCHED "
                      GLOBALFLAGS="-D_WINNT -D_INTEL -D_CRT_SECURE_NO_DEPRECATE -D_USE_32BIT_TIME_T"
                      Use the last one to compile Earthworm feature under Windows-MinGW.

    * Enable only libmseed and seedlink
          ./configure --disable-ew \
                      CFLAGS="-O2 -Wall -pipe -I/<anywhere>/libmseed" \
                      LDFLAGS="-L/<anywhere>/libmseed"

  Verifying the version and enabled features after compilation:

     src/nmxptool --version

     nmxptool 2.1.0, tool for Nanometrics Protocols
              Private Data Stream 1.4, Data Access Protocol 1.0
              Enabled features: libmseed YES, SeedLink YES, Earthworm YES.
              Using pthread: YES.

  * libmseed, The Mini-SEED library - http://www.iris.edu/manuals/
         If available within include and library path,
         this library allows to save retrieved data in Mini-SEED records.
         You might add to CFLAGS this "-I/<anywhere>/libmseed"
         and to LDFLAGS this "-L/<anywhere>/libmseed",
         do not forget to run 'ranlib libmseed.a' or similars.

  * ew, Earthworm System - http://www.isti2.com/ew/
         nmxptool is included into the official Earthworm distribution since the version 7.2.
         Anyway, you can compile nmxptool outside the EW distribution, for example, to upgrade.
         Before launching 'configure', run the appropriate script from directory 'environment',
         the compilation depends on the following environment variables:
             $EW_HOME, $EW_VERSION, $EW_PARAMS and $GLOBALFLAGS.
         'configure' looks for necessary Earthworm object files inside $EW_HOME/$EW_VERSION/lib
         and link them to nmxptool in order to enable Earthworm module feature.
         If some of object files are missing then it will attempt to discover sources
         dependents on your operating system and it will compile them before linking.

         Install binary and configuration files for Earthworm:

             make install-ew-bin
             make install-ew-conf (ONLY THE FIRST TIME)

         The first command copies nmxptool binary in $EW_HOME/$EW_VERSION/bin
         The second command copies earthworm/nmxptool.d, earthworm/nmxptool.desc in $EW_PARAMS
         If you are upgrading nmxptool then you might do that:

             make install-ew-doc

         Last command copies nmxptool_ovr.html and nmxptool_cmd.html into the directories
	 $EW_HOME/$EW_VERSION/ewdoc/WEB_DOC/ovr and $EW_HOME/$EW_VERSION/ewdoc/WEB_DOC/cmd

  * seedlink, SeisComP - http://www.gfz-potsdam.de/geofon/seiscomp/
         Seedlink is a system for near real time seismic data distribution.
         Inside the directory 'src' has been copied files
         'seedlink_plugin.c' and 'seedlink_plugin.h' from 'plugin.c' and 'plugin.h'
         belonging to the SeisComP 2.5 distribution.

         If your SeisComP root directory is not equal to /home/sysop/seiscomp,
         you have to launch the script 'configure' in the following way:

             ./configure ... ... SEISCOMPDIR=/<where>/<seiscompdir>/<is>

         Install binary and template files for SeedLink:

             make install-seiscomp-bin
             make install-seiscomp-templates (ONLY THE FIRST TIME)

         The first command copies nmxptool binary in %SEISCOMPDIR%/acquisition/bin
         The second command copies the directories
             seiscomp_templates/135_nmxptool
             seiscomp_templates/136_nmxptool_dod
         in %SEISCOMPDIR%/acquisition/templates/source/

         After, you can use:

             seiscomp config

- NAQSSERVER CONFIGURATION

   * Data continuity when short disconnections to NaqsServer occur

   Inside the section Datastream of the file Naqs.ini set DataBufferLength to a high value.

       [ Datastream ] 
         Port = 28000              // TCP port for control/data connections to Naqs 
         Password = none           // access password (not used in version 1.3) 
         MaxConnections = 10       // maximum number of simultaneous connections 
         SocketType = Direct       // connection type (Direct or Callback) 
         DataBufferLength = 100    // Buffer length for data channels (# packets)

   * Packet retransmission

   Inside the section NetworkInterface of the file Naqs.ini enable RetxRequest.
   If RetxRequest is not enabled then MaxTolerableLatency is ineffective.

       [ NetworkInterface ] 
         Port = 32000           // UDP port for incoming NMX data (usually 32000) 
         SendDelay = 250        // milliseconds to delay after each send 
         RetxRequest = Enabled
         MulticastGroup = 224.1.1.1 
     

- DOCUMENTATION
    * Print nmxptool help:

- SIGNAL HANDLING

    You can send the following signals to nmxptool:

         Signals INT QUIT TERM : Sending these signals to nmxptool causes it
                                 to immediately attempt to gracefully terminate. 
                                 It may take several seconds to complete exiting.

         Signal  ALRM          : Print current info about Raw Stream buffer.

         Signal  USR1          : Force to close a connection and open again
                                 without quitting the program. Only for connection
                                 in near real-time to NaqsServer.

         Signals HUP PIPE      : Ignored. (SIG_IGN)
