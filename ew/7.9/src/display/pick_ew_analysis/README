This is a very nice Java GUI provided by Ruben S. Luís of
Centro de Vulcanologia e Avaliação de Riscos Geológicos
Universidade dos Açores 
that provides the ability to visualize the settings in
your pick_ew file against trace data on which picks are made.

This can run on any platform that supports Java Version 1.6
or higher.

To run it, simply type:

java -jar pick_ew_analysis.jar 

on the command line and connect to a pick_ew stations file
and to a wave_serverV where data maybe found. The GUI.
