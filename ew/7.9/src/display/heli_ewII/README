This is the readme file for heli_ewII 

History:
	Jim Luetgert created the original heli1 10/7/98. He did all the hard work.
	Pete Lombard then did extensive cleaned and debugged. This effort resulted in two
	versions: heli_standalone, which was a free-standing program (although
	using earthworm functions), and heli_ew, which ran as a Module, thus providing
	error processing and restarts.
		Meanwhile, Jim Luetgert and others proceeded to develop and enhance similar
	programs. We're aware of six such efforts. What to do. Given Pete's efforts 
	to stabilize heli_standalone, and its proven track-record for reliability, and
	that we're to provide a mission-critical system, as well as a community effort,
	we're producing heli_ewII as the staid, reliable, supported product. It is a combination
	of heli_ew and heli_standalone. 
		We will carry fancier products as contributed to us by others in the 
	earthworm/Contrib section. From time to time, we may adopt and adapt some 
	of these more advanced products into the core earthworm software.

Features:

	1. Runs on NT and Solaris.

	2. Runs as a module: Specifying earthworm parameters in its
	   configuration file will cause it to become a module. It will attach to
	   the specified ring, produce heartbeats, and use earthworm logging. It can
	   be restarted if it asserts 'restartMe' in its .desc file.

	3. Runs as a standalone program: If no Earthworm paramters are given in the
	   .d file, it will run standalone. Errors will be written to stderr.

	4. Does not try to move files to another machine. This was removed in the name
	   of security and modularity. Moving the image files to a separate server machine
	   is a reasonable option, but should be done by another facility. Shared disks via
	   operating system features or SendFile are two options.

As it stands, heli_ewII is not well-structured or easy to follow. A continual effort to
correct this is underway. Maybe someday Carol Bryant wil save us...
