These displays digitally simulate actual seismograms that are
routinely recorded at the University of Washington earthquake
laboratory. The  seismograms show a record of how the ground
moved at a particular seismograph station in the Pacific Northwest
during a 24-hour period. The seismogram is "read" like a book,
from left to right and top to bottom (this is the direction that
time increases). As with a book, the right end of any horizontal
line "connects" with the left end of the line below it.
The colors of the horizontal lines have no particular significance.
<P>
The vertical lines are not part of the seismogram but are present
to indicate equal intervals of time. 
Time is indicated at the left
end of some of the lines in local Pacific time and at the right end
of some lines in Universal (or Greenwich) time.
<P>
When an earthquake occurs the seismogram
will show ground motion fluctuations that typically last from 
several tens of seconds to many minutes depending on the size 
of the earthquake. The height of the recorded waves on the seismogram
(wave amplitude) is a greatly magnified representation of the actual
ground motion. The magnification is roughly 100,000 times or more.
A recording of an earthquake has recognizable characteristics. 
Typically, once can recognize the arrival of different
wave types: P (the fastest traveling waves), S, and Surface waves.
<P>
On these seismograms you may see local earthquakes in the Pacific
Northwest or even earthquakes elsewhere in the world. Almost any
earthquake in the World having a magnitude greater than 5.5
will be seen on these seismograms. For distant earthquakes
be sure to look at one of the "broad band" seismograms. Broad-band
seismic instruments are particularly sensitive to low-frequency
ground motions generated by large earthquakes. Some types of seismic
waves (for example surface waves) from a distant earthquake
will only be visible on broad band seismograms.
<P>
Not all the wiggles seen on the seismograms are due to earthquakes.
Anything that produces ground vibrations could be recorded, for example
a car that passes by the seismometer (this is why we try to locate
most of our seismometers well away from roads). Since the
electrical signals from the seismometers are typcally transmitted
to the University of Washington over telephone wires any electrical
noise on the telephone lines will also show up on the seismogram.
Such noise is usually easy to distinguish from earthquake generated
signals because the the noise is often "spikey" in appearance.
<P>
Other interesting signals may be recorded. For example rockfalls
(see a station near Mount St Helens), icequakes in glaciers
(see station RCS), or man-made blasts (for example the
quarry blasts near Centralia, WA each day).
