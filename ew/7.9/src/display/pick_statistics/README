This is a contribution by Ruben Luis of CVARG Jan 4, 2012:

Starting the application as:

java -jar PickStatistics.jar [target]

the application will open a graphical dialog with the list of stations found in [target]. The target is optional and may be a file or a folder. In the latter case, PickStatistics will recursively scan all files and subfolders. Within the graphical dialog, you may open a new file, folder or set of files and folders to compute new statistics. The table of statistics can be sorted and the previous bug with the order has been fixed.


When starting the application as:

java -jar PickStatistics.jar <target> <S.C.N.L>

the application will NOT open a graphical dialog. Instead, it will scan the <target> and search for picks with the channel <S.C.N.L>. Then it will try and plot the pick count for that channel. This is good if you need to run scripts over the statistics and automate alerts.

Here is an output example:
java -jar PickStatistics.jar binder_ak_ew_20111226.log MSW.EHZ.AV.--

Besides this new stuff I have added another functionality. Now it is possible to have a configuration XML file in the working dir. This file allows controlling some additional parameters, such as the duration of the integration period. This is one hour (3600000 milliseconds) by default but may be changed to much longer periods, if necessary.
I have included an example file in attachment, with some explanatory comments. Note that the configuration file is NOT mandatory.
