Wave Viewer Known Bugs & "FEATURES"

Cache should never be shorter than the screen.
So cache must be greater than SecondsOnDisplay * SampleRate

When in auto-scroll mode, wave_viewer occassionaly fails to 
draw trace on the screen when it should appear.  The result
looks like a gap.  Pressing any button that causes a redraw
of the trace will clear the fake gap (up, down, BIAS, add
a trace, drop a trace, etc.)
This problem usually happens when wave_viewer is CPU 
challenged and constantly requesting data.
