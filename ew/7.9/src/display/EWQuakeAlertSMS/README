Version as of April 18, 2011 from Ruben Luis:

This tool receives an import of HYP2000ARC messages and will build
a email to send to up to 5 users. The email will contain a google map,
a human readable text message about the event origin, and a .png image
of the waveforms referred to in the message (with picks labelled).


Requires Java 1.6


To run it:

java -jar EWQuakeAlert.jar

Follow the configuration instructions to setup the import and where
a wave_serverV is to get waveform info for the .png plot.
