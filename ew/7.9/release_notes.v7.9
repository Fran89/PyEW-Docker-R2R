MODIFICATIONS/BUG FIXES TO EXISTING MODULES:
********************************************
hyp71_mgr
Corrected several arc output message bugs.
Phase calculated residuals were often wrongly reported.
If a station was missing in hyp71_mgr configuration, this would lead to a complete mix in arc message output.
In some cases, the reported result was not the calculated one.
Corrected hyp2000arc to Hypo71 card phase conversion when second was lower than 10
Corrected hyp2000arc to Hypo71 card phase conversion when first arrival was an S-phase
Jean-Marie Saurel    October 10, 2016

ewthresh
Modified WaitBeforeNextThresh command to take optional second argument SameNetSta; 
if present, looks at all of Net/Sta to decide if enough time has passed for a new message.
Also added WaitBeforeMessages command: how long to wait after startup before generating messages.
Scott Hunter        April 13, 2016

Paul Friberg April 5, 2016

Corrected bug that caused Hyp2000arcCompatibilityMode to mix events.
Corrected bug in read_arc library that caused segfaults when using write_phs.
Jean-Marie Saurel    February 23, 2016
